1|1|in the name of allah, the entir merciful, the especi merciful.
1|2|[all] prais is [due] to allah, lord of the world -
1|3|the entir merciful, the especi merciful,
1|4|sovereign of the day of recompense.
1|5|it is you we worship and you we ask for help.
1|6|guid us to the straight path -
1|7|the path of those upon whom you have bestow favor, not of those who have evok [your] anger or of those who are astray.
2|1|alif, lam, meem.
2|2|thi is the book about which there is no doubt, a guidanc for those consciou of allah -
2|3|who believ in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provid for them,
2|4|and who believ in what ha been reveal to you, [O muhammad], and what wa reveal befor you, and of the hereaft they are certain [in faith].
2|5|thos are upon [right] guidanc from their lord, and it is those who are the successful.
2|6|indeed, those who disbeliev - it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe.
2|7|allah ha set a seal upon their heart and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. and for them is a great punishment.
2|8|and of the peopl are some who say, "we believ in allah and the last day," but they are not believers.
2|9|they [think to] deceiv allah and those who believe, but they deceiv not except themselv and perceiv [it] not.
2|10|in their heart is disease, so allah ha increas their disease; and for them is a pain punish becaus they [habitually] use to lie.
2|11|and when it is said to them, "do not caus corrupt on the earth," they say, "we are but reformers."
2|12|unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceiv [it] not.
2|13|and when it is said to them, "believ as the peopl have believed," they say, "should we believ as the foolish have believed?" unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they know [it] not.
2|14|and when they meet those who believe, they say, "we believe"; but when they are alon with their evil ones, they say, "indeed, we are with you; we were onli mockers."
2|15|[but] allah mock them and prolong them in their transgress [while] they wander blindly.
2|16|thos are the one who have purchas error [in exchange] for guidance, so their transact ha brought no profit, nor were they guided.
2|17|their exampl is that of one who kindl a fire, but when it illumin what wa around him, allah took away their light and left them in dark [so] they could not see.
2|18|deaf, dumb and blind - so they will not return [to the right path].
2|19|or [it is] like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness, thunder and lightning. they put their finger in their ear against the thunderclap in dread of death. but allah is encompass of the disbelievers.
2|20|th lightn almost snatch away their sight. everi time it light [the way] for them, they walk therein; but when dark come over them, they stand [still]. and if allah had willed, He could have taken away their hear and their sight. indeed, allah is over all thing competent.
2|21|o mankind, worship your lord, who creat you and those befor you, that you may becom righteou -
2|22|[he] who made for you the earth a bed [spread out] and the sky a ceil and sent down from the sky, rain and brought forth therebi fruit as provis for you. So do not attribut to allah equal while you know [that there is noth similar to him].
2|23|and if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon our servant [muhammad], then produc a surah the like thereof and call upon your wit other than allah, if you should be truthful.
2|24|but if you do not - and you will never be abl to - then fear the fire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepar for the disbelievers.
2|25|and give good tide to those who believ and do righteou deed that they will have garden [in paradise] beneath which river flow. whenev they are provid with a provis of fruit therefrom, they will say, "thi is what we were provid with before." and it is given to them in likeness. and they will have therein purifi spouses, and they will abid therein eternally.
2|26|indeed, allah is not timid to present an exampl - that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it. and those who have believ know that it is the truth from their lord. but as for those who disbelieve, they say, "what did allah intend by thi as an example?" He mislead mani therebi and guid mani thereby. and He mislead not except the defiantli disobedient,
2|27|who break the coven of allah after contract it and sever that which allah ha order to be join and caus corrupt on earth. It is those who are the losers.
2|28|how can you disbeliev in allah when you were lifeless and He brought you to life; then He will caus you to die, then He will bring you [back] to life, and then to him you will be returned.
2|29|it is He who creat for you all of that which is on the earth. then He direct himself to the heaven, [hi be abov all creation], and made them seven heavens, and He is know of all things.
2|30|and [mention, O muhammad], when your lord said to the angels, "indeed, I will make upon the earth a success authority." they said, "will you place upon it one who caus corrupt therein and shed blood, while we declar your prais and sanctifi you?" allah said, "indeed, I know that which you do not know."
2|31|and He taught adam the name - all of them. then He show them to the angel and said, "inform Me of the name of these, if you are truthful."
2|32|they said, "exalt are you; we have no knowledg except what you have taught us. indeed, it is you who is the knowing, the wise."
2|33|h said, "O adam, inform them of their names." and when he had inform them of their names, He said, "did I not tell you that I know the unseen [aspects] of the heaven and the earth? and I know what you reveal and what you have concealed."
2|34|and [mention] when We said to the angels, "prostrat befor adam"; so they prostrated, except for iblees. He refus and wa arrog and becam of the disbelievers.
2|35|and We said, "O adam, dwell, you and your wife, in paradis and eat therefrom in [eas and] abund from wherev you will. but do not approach thi tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers."
2|36|but satan caus them to slip out of it and remov them from that [condition] in which they had been. and We said, "go down, [all of you], as enemi to one another, and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provis for a time."
2|37|then adam receiv from hi lord [some] words, and He accept hi repentance. indeed, it is He who is the accept of repentance, the merciful.
2|38|w said, "go down from it, all of you. and when guidanc come to you from me, whoever follow My guidanc - there will be no fear concern them, nor will they grieve.
2|39|and those who disbeliev and deni our sign - those will be companion of the fire; they will abid therein eternally."
2|40|o children of israel, rememb My favor which I have bestow upon you and fulfil My coven [upon you] that I will fulfil your coven [from me], and be afraid of [only] me.
2|41|and believ in what I have sent down confirm that which is [already] with you, and be not the first to disbeliev in it. and do not exchang My sign for a small price, and fear [only] me.
2|42|and do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know [it].
2|43|and establish prayer and give zakah and bow with those who bow [in worship and obedience].
2|44|do you order righteous of the peopl and forget yourselv while you recit the scripture? then will you not reason?
2|45|and seek help through patienc and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbl submiss [to allah]
2|46|who are certain that they will meet their lord and that they will return to him.
2|47|o children of israel, rememb My favor that I have bestow upon you and that I prefer you over the worlds.
2|48|and fear a day when no soul will suffic for anoth soul at all, nor will intercess be accept from it, nor will compens be taken from it, nor will they be aided.
2|49|and [recall] when We save your forefath from the peopl of pharaoh, who afflict you with the worst torment, slaughter your [newborn] son and keep your femal alive. and in that wa a great trial from your lord.
2|50|and [recall] when We part the sea for you and save you and drown the peopl of pharaoh while you were look on.
2|51|and [recall] when We made an appoint with mose for forti nights. then you took [for worship] the calf after him, while you were wrongdoers.
2|52|then We forgav you after that so perhap you would be grateful.
2|53|and [recall] when We gave mose the scriptur and criterion that perhap you would be guided.
2|54|and [recall] when mose said to hi people, "O my people, inde you have wrong yourselv by your take of the calf [for worship]. So repent to your creator and kill yourselves. that is best for [all of] you in the sight of your creator." then He accept your repentance; indeed, He is the accept of repentance, the merciful.
2|55|and [recall] when you said, "O moses, we will never believ you until we see allah outright"; so the thunderbolt took you while you were look on.
2|56|then We reviv you after your death that perhap you would be grateful.
2|57|and We shade you with cloud and sent down to you manna and quails, [saying], "eat from the good thing with which We have provid you." and they wrong Us not - but they were [only] wrong themselves.
2|58|and [recall] when We said, "enter thi citi and eat from it wherev you will in [eas and] abundance, and enter the gate bow humbl and say, 'reliev us of our burdens.' We will [then] forgiv your sin for you, and We will increas the doer of good [in good and reward]."
2|59|but those who wrong chang [those words] to a statement other than that which had been said to them, so We sent down upon those who wrong a punish from the sky becaus they were defiantli disobeying.
2|60|and [recall] when mose pray for water for hi people, so We said, "strike with your staff the stone." and there gush forth from it twelv springs, and everi peopl knew it water place. "eat and drink from the provis of allah, and do not commit abus on the earth, spread corruption."
2|61|and [recall] when you said, "O moses, we can never endur one [kind of] food. So call upon your lord to bring forth for us from the earth it green herb and it cucumb and it garlic and it lentil and it onions." [moses] said, "would you exchang what is better for what is less? Go into [any] settlement and indeed, you will have what you have asked." and they were cover with humili and poverti and return with anger from allah [upon them]. that wa becaus they [repeatedly] disbeliev in the sign of allah and kill the prophet without right. that wa becaus they disobey and were [habitually] transgressing.
2|62|indeed, those who believ and those who were jew or christian or sabean [befor prophet muhammad] - those [among them] who believ in allah and the last day and did righteous - will have their reward with their lord, and no fear will there be concern them, nor will they grieve.
2|63|and [recall] when We took your covenant, [O children of israel, to abid by the torah] and We rais over you the mount, [saying], "take what We have given you with determin and rememb what is in it that perhap you may becom righteous."
2|64|then you turn away after that. and if not for the favor of allah upon you and hi mercy, you would have been among the losers.
2|65|and you had alreadi known about those who transgress among you concern the sabbath, and We said to them, "be apes, despised."
2|66|and We made it a deterr punish for those who were present and those who succeed [them] and a lesson for those who fear allah.
2|67|and [recall] when mose said to hi people, "indeed, allah command you to slaughter a cow." they said, "do you take us in ridicule?" He said, "I seek refug in allah from be among the ignorant."
2|68|they said, "call upon your lord to make clear to us what it is." [moses] said, "[allah] says, 'it is a cow which is neither old nor virgin, but median between that,' so do what you are commanded."
2|69|they said, "call upon your lord to show us what is her color." He said, "he says, 'it is a yellow cow, bright in color - pleas to the observers.' "
2|70|they said, "call upon your lord to make clear to us what it is. indeed, [all] cow look alik to us. and inde we, if allah wills, will be guided."
2|71|h said, "he says, 'it is a cow neither train to plow the earth nor to irrig the field, one free from fault with no spot upon her.' " they said, "now you have come with the truth." So they slaughter her, but they could hardli do it.
2|72|and [recall] when you slew a man and disput over it, but allah wa to bring out that which you were concealing.
2|73|so, We said, "strike the slain man with part of it." thu doe allah bring the dead to life, and He show you hi sign that you might reason.
2|74|then your heart becam harden after that, be like stone or even harder. for indeed, there are stone from which river burst forth, and there are some of them that split open and water come out, and there are some of them that fall down for fear of allah. and allah is not unawar of what you do.
2|75|do you covet [the hope, O believers], that they would believ for you while a parti of them use to hear the word of allah and then distort the torah after they had understood it while they were knowing?
2|76|and when they meet those who believe, they say, "we have believed"; but when they are alon with one another, they say, "do you talk to them about what allah ha reveal to you so they can argu with you about it befor your lord?" then will you not reason?
2|77|but do they not know that allah know what they conceal and what they declare?
2|78|and among them are unlett one who do not know the scriptur except in wish thinking, but they are onli assuming.
2|79|so woe to those who write the "scripture" with their own hands, then say, "thi is from allah," in order to exchang it for a small price. woe to them for what their hand have written and woe to them for what they earn.
2|80|and they say, "never will the fire touch us, except for a few days." say, "have you taken a coven with allah? for allah will never break hi covenant. Or do you say about allah that which you do not know?"
2|81|yes, whoever earn evil and hi sin ha encompass him - those are the companion of the fire; they will abid therein eternally.
2|82|but they who believ and do righteou deed - those are the companion of paradise; they will abid therein eternally.
2|83|and [recall] when We took the coven from the children of israel, [enjoin upon them], "do not worship except allah; and to parent do good and to relatives, orphans, and the needy. and speak to peopl good [words] and establish prayer and give zakah." then you turn away, except a few of you, and you were refusing.
2|84|and [recall] when We took your covenant, [saying], "do not shed each other' blood or evict one anoth from your homes." then you acknowledg [this] while you were witnessing.
2|85|then, you are those [same one who are] kill one anoth and evict a parti of your peopl from their homes, cooper against them in sin and aggression. and if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their evict wa forbidden to you. So do you believ in part of the scriptur and disbeliev in part? then what is the recompens for those who do that among you except disgrac in worldli life; and on the day of resurrect they will be sent back to the severest of punishment. and allah is not unawar of what you do.
2|86|thos are the one who have bought the life of thi world [in exchange] for the hereafter, so the punish will not be lighten for them, nor will they be aided.
2|87|and We did certainli give mose the torah and follow up after him with messengers. and We gave jesus, the son of mary, clear proof and support him with the pure spirit. but is it [not] that everi time a messeng came to you, [O children of israel], with what your soul did not desire, you were arrogant? and a parti [of messengers] you deni and anoth parti you killed.
2|88|and they said, "our heart are wrapped." but, [in fact], allah ha curs them for their disbelief, so littl is it that they believe.
2|89|and when there came to them a book from allah confirm that which wa with them - although befor they use to pray for victori against those who disbeliev - but [then] when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbeliev in it; so the curs of allah will be upon the disbelievers.
2|90|how wretch is that for which they sold themselv - that they would disbeliev in what allah ha reveal through [their] outrag that allah would send down hi favor upon whom He will from among hi servants. So they return have [earned] wrath upon wrath. and for the disbeliev is a humili punishment.
2|91|and when it is said to them, "believ in what allah ha revealed," they say, "we believ [only] in what wa reveal to us." and they disbeliev in what came after it, while it is the truth confirm that which is with them. say, "then whi did you kill the prophet of allah before, if you are [indeed] believers?"
2|92|and mose had certainli brought you clear proofs. then you took the calf [in worship] after that, while you were wrongdoers.
2|93|and [recall] when We took your coven and rais over you the mount, [saying], "take what We have given you with determin and listen." they said [instead], "we hear and disobey." and their heart absorb [the worship of] the calf becaus of their disbelief. say, "how wretch is that which your faith enjoin upon you, if you should be believers."
2|94|say, [O muhammad], "if the home of the hereaft with allah is for you alon and not the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful.
2|95|but they will never wish for it, ever, becaus of what their hand have put forth. and allah is know of the wrongdoers.
2|96|and you will sure find them the most greedi of peopl for life - [even] more than those who associ other with allah. one of them wish that he could be grant life a thousand years, but it would not remov him in the least from the [coming] punish that he should be grant life. and allah is see of what they do.
2|97|say, "whoever is an enemi to gabriel - it is [none but] he who ha brought the qur'an down upon your heart, [O muhammad], by permiss of allah, confirm that which wa befor it and as guidanc and good tide for the believers."
2|98|whoev is an enemi to allah and hi angel and hi messeng and gabriel and michael - then indeed, allah is an enemi to the disbelievers.
2|99|and We have certainli reveal to you vers [which are] clear proofs, and no one would deni them except the defiantli disobedient.
2|100|i it not [true] that everi time they took a coven a parti of them threw it away? but, [in fact], most of them do not believe.
2|101|and when a messeng from allah came to them confirm that which wa with them, a parti of those who had been given the scriptur threw the scriptur of allah behind their back as if they did not know [what it contained].
2|102|and they follow [instead] what the devil had recit dure the reign of solomon. It wa not solomon who disbelieved, but the devil disbelieved, teach peopl magic and that which wa reveal to the two angel at babylon, harut and marut. but the two angel do not teach anyon unless they say, "we are a trial, so do not disbeliev [bi practic magic]." and [yet] they learn from them that by which they caus separ between a man and hi wife. but they do not harm anyon through it except by permiss of allah. and the peopl learn what harm them and doe not benefit them. but the children of israel certainli knew that whoever purchas the magic would not have in the hereaft ani share. and wretch is that for which they sold themselves, if they onli knew.
2|103|and if they had believ and fear allah, then the reward from allah would have been [far] better, if they onli knew.
2|104|o you who have believed, say not [to allah 's messenger], "ra'ina" but say, "unthurna" and listen. and for the disbeliev is a pain punishment.
2|105|neith those who disbeliev from the peopl of the scriptur nor the polytheist wish that ani good should be sent down to you from your lord. but allah select for hi merci whom He wills, and allah is the possessor of great bounty.
2|106|w do not abrog a vers or caus it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that allah is over all thing competent?
2|107|do you not know that to allah belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth and [that] you have not besid allah ani protector or ani helper?
2|108|or do you intend to ask your messeng as mose wa ask before? and whoever exchang faith for disbelief ha certainli stray from the sound of the way.
2|109|mani of the peopl of the scriptur wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envi from themselv [even] after the truth ha becom clear to them. So pardon and overlook until allah deliv hi command. indeed, allah is over all thing competent.
2|110|and establish prayer and give zakah, and whatev good you put forward for yourselv - you will find it with allah. indeed, allah of what you do, is seeing.
2|111|and they say, "none will enter paradis except one who is a jew or a christian." that is [merely] their wish thinking, say, "produc your proof, if you should be truthful."
2|112|y [on the contrary], whoever submit hi face in islam to allah while be a doer of good will have hi reward with hi lord. and no fear will there be concern them, nor will they grieve.
2|113|th jew say "the christian have noth [true] to stand on," and the christian say, "the jew have noth to stand on," although they [both] recit the scripture. thu the polytheist speak the same as their words. but allah will judg between them on the day of resurrect concern that over which they use to differ.
2|114|and who are more unjust than those who prevent the name of allah from be mention in hi mosqu and strive toward their destruction. It is not for them to enter them except in fear. for them in thi world is disgrace, and they will have in the hereaft a great punishment.
2|115|and to allah belong the east and the west. So wherev you [might] turn, there is the face of allah. indeed, allah is all-encompass and knowing.
2|116|they say, "allah ha taken a son." exalt is he! rather, to him belong whatev is in the heaven and the earth. all are devoutli obedi to him,
2|117|origin of the heaven and the earth. when He decre a matter, He onli say to it, "be," and it is.
2|118|thos who do not know say, "whi doe allah not speak to us or there come to us a sign?" thu spoke those befor them like their words. their heart resembl each other. We have shown clearli the sign to a peopl who are certain [in faith].
2|119|indeed, We have sent you, [O muhammad], with the truth as a bringer of good tide and a warner, and you will not be ask about the companion of hellfire.
2|120|and never will the jew or the christian approv of you until you follow their religion. say, "indeed, the guidanc of allah is the [only] guidance." If you were to follow their desir after what ha come to you of knowledge, you would have against allah no protector or helper.
2|121|thos to whom We have given the book recit it with it true recital. they [are the one who] believ in it. and whoever disbeliev in it - it is they who are the losers.
2|122|o children of israel, rememb My favor which I have bestow upon you and that I prefer you over the worlds.
2|123|and fear a day when no soul will suffic for anoth soul at all, and no compens will be accept from it, nor will ani intercess benefit it, nor will they be aided.
2|124|and [mention, O muhammad], when abraham wa tri by hi lord with command and he fulfil them. [allah] said, "indeed, I will make you a leader for the people." [abraham] said, "and of my descendants?" [allah] said, "mi coven doe not includ the wrongdoers."
2|125|and [mention] when We made the hous a place of return for the peopl and [a place of] security. and take, [O believers], from the stand place of abraham a place of prayer. and We charg abraham and ishmael, [saying], "purifi My hous for those who perform tawaf and those who are stay [there] for worship and those who bow and prostrat [in prayer]."
2|126|and [mention] when abraham said, "mi lord, make thi a secur citi and provid it peopl with fruit - whoever of them believ in allah and the last day." [allah] said. "and whoever disbeliev - I will grant him enjoy for a little; then I will forc him to the punish of the fire, and wretch is the destination."
2|127|and [mention] when abraham wa rais the foundat of the hous and [with him] ishmael, [saying], "our lord, accept [this] from us. inde you are the hearing, the knowing.
2|128|our lord, and make us muslim [in submission] to you and from our descend a muslim nation [in submission] to you. and show us our rite and accept our repentance. indeed, you are the accept of repentance, the merciful.
2|129|our lord, and send among them a messeng from themselv who will recit to them your vers and teach them the book and wisdom and purifi them. indeed, you are the exalt in might, the wise."
2|130|and who would be avers to the religion of abraham except one who make a fool of himself. and We had chosen him in thi world, and inde he, in the hereafter, will be among the righteous.
2|131|when hi lord said to him, "submit", he said "I have submit [in islam] to the lord of the worlds."
2|132|and abraham instruct hi son [to do the same] and [so did] jacob, [saying], "O my sons, inde allah ha chosen for you thi religion, so do not die except while you are muslims."
2|133|or were you wit when death approach jacob, when he said to hi sons, "what will you worship after me?" they said, "we will worship your god and the god of your fathers, abraham and ishmael and isaac - one god. and we are muslim [in submission] to him."
2|134|that wa a nation which ha pass on. It will have [the consequ of] what it earned, and you will have what you have earned. and you will not be ask about what they use to do.
2|135|they say, "be jew or christian [so] you will be guided." say, "rather, [we follow] the religion of abraham, inclin toward truth, and he wa not of the polytheists."
2|136|say, [O believers], "we have believ in allah and what ha been reveal to us and what ha been reveal to abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the descend and what wa given to mose and jesu and what wa given to the prophet from their lord. We make no distinct between ani of them, and we are muslim [in submission] to him."
2|137|so if they believ in the same as you believ in, then they have been [rightly] guided; but if they turn away, they are onli in dissension, and allah will be suffici for you against them. and He is the hearing, the knowing.
2|138|[and say, "our is] the religion of allah. and who is better than allah in [ordaining] religion? and we are worshipp of him."
2|139|say, [O muhammad], "do you argu with us about allah while He is our lord and your lord? for us are our deeds, and for you are your deeds. and we are sincer [in deed and intention] to him."
2|140|or do you say that abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the descend were jew or christians? say, "are you more know or is allah?" and who is more unjust than one who conceal a testimoni he ha from allah? and allah is not unawar of what you do.
2|141|that is a nation which ha pass on. It will have [the consequ of] what it earned, and you will have what you have earned. and you will not be ask about what they use to do.
2|142|th foolish among the peopl will say, "what ha turn them away from their qiblah, which they use to face?" say, "to allah belong the east and the west. He guid whom He will to a straight path."
2|143|and thu we have made you a just commun that you will be wit over the peopl and the messeng will be a wit over you. and We did not make the qiblah which you use to face except that We might make evid who would follow the messeng from who would turn back on hi heels. and indeed, it is difficult except for those whom allah ha guided. and never would allah have caus you to lose your faith. inde allah is, to the people, kind and merciful.
2|144|w have certainli seen the turn of your face, [O muhammad], toward the heaven, and We will sure turn you to a qiblah with which you will be pleased. So turn your face toward al-masjid al-haram. and wherev you [believers] are, turn your face toward it [in prayer]. indeed, those who have been given the scriptur well know that it is the truth from their lord. and allah is not unawar of what they do.
2|145|and if you brought to those who were given the scriptur everi sign, they would not follow your qiblah. nor will you be a follow of their qiblah. nor would they be follow of one another' qiblah. So if you were to follow their desir after what ha come to you of knowledge, indeed, you would then be among the wrongdoers.
2|146|thos to whom We gave the scriptur know him as they know their own sons. but indeed, a parti of them conceal the truth while they know [it].
2|147|th truth is from your lord, so never be among the doubters.
2|148|for each [religi following] is a direct toward which it faces. So race to [all that is] good. wherev you may be, allah will bring you forth [for judgement] all together. indeed, allah is over all thing competent.
2|149|so from wherev you go out [for prayer, O muhammad] turn your face toward al- masjid al-haram, and indeed, it is the truth from your lord. and allah is not unawar of what you do.
2|150|and from wherev you go out [for prayer], turn your face toward al-masjid al-haram. and wherev you [believers] may be, turn your face toward it in order that the peopl will not have ani argument against you, except for those of them who commit wrong; so fear them not but fear me. and [it is] so I may complet My favor upon you and that you may be guided.
2|151|just as We have sent among you a messeng from yourselv recit to you our vers and purifi you and teach you the book and wisdom and teach you that which you did not know.
2|152|so rememb me; I will rememb you. and be grate to Me and do not deni me.
2|153|o you who have believed, seek help through patienc and prayer. indeed, allah is with the patient.
2|154|and do not say about those who are kill in the way of allah, "they are dead." rather, they are alive, but you perceiv [it] not.
2|155|and We will sure test you with someth of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and live and fruits, but give good tide to the patient,
2|156|who, when disast strike them, say, "inde we belong to allah, and inde to him we will return."
2|157|thos are the one upon whom are bless from their lord and mercy. and it is those who are the [rightly] guided.
2|158|indeed, as-safa and al-marwah are among the symbol of allah. So whoever make hajj to the hous or perform 'umrah - there is no blame upon him for walk between them. and whoever volunt good - then indeed, allah is appreci and knowing.
2|159|indeed, those who conceal what We sent down of clear proof and guidanc after We made it clear for the peopl in the scriptur - those are curs by allah and curs by those who curse,
2|160|except for those who repent and correct themselv and make evid [what they concealed]. those - I will accept their repentance, and I am the accept of repentance, the merciful.
2|161|indeed, those who disbeliev and die while they are disbeliev - upon them will be the curs of allah and of the angel and the people, all together,
2|162|abid etern therein. the punish will not be lighten for them, nor will they be reprieved.
2|163|and your god is one god. there is no deiti [worthi of worship] except him, the entir merciful, the especi merciful.
2|164|indeed, in the creation of the heaven and earth, and the altern of the night and the day, and the [great] ship which sail through the sea with that which benefit people, and what allah ha sent down from the heaven of rain, give life therebi to the earth after it lifeless and dispers therein everi [kind of] move creature, and [his] direct of the wind and the cloud control between the heaven and the earth are sign for a peopl who use reason.
2|165|and [yet], among the peopl are those who take other than allah as equal [to him]. they love them as they [should] love allah. but those who believ are stronger in love for allah. and if onli they who have wrong would consid [that] when they see the punishment, [they will be certain] that all power belong to allah and that allah is sever in punishment.
2|166|[and they should consid that] when those who have been follow disassoci themselv from those who follow [them], and they [all] see the punishment, and cut off from them are the tie [of relationship],
2|167|thos who follow will say, "if onli we had anoth turn [at worldli life] so we could disassoci ourselv from them as they have disassoci themselv from us." thu will allah show them their deed as regret upon them. and they are never to emerg from the fire.
2|168|o mankind, eat from whatev is on earth [that is] law and good and do not follow the footstep of satan. indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.
2|169|h onli order you to evil and immor and to say about allah what you do not know.
2|170|and when it is said to them, "follow what allah ha revealed," they say, "rather, we will follow that which we found our father doing." even though their father understood nothing, nor were they guided?
2|171|th exampl of those who disbeliev is like that of one who shout at what hear noth but call and cri cattl or sheep - deaf, dumb and blind, so they do not understand.
2|172|o you who have believed, eat from the good thing which We have provid for you and be grate to allah if it is [indeed] him that you worship.
2|173|h ha onli forbidden to you dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which ha been dedic to other than allah. but whoever is forc [bi necessity], neither desir [it] nor transgress [it limit], there is no sin upon him. indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
2|174|indeed, they who conceal what allah ha sent down of the book and exchang it for a small price - those consum not into their belli except the fire. and allah will not speak to them on the day of resurrection, nor will He purifi them. and they will have a pain punishment.
2|175|thos are the one who have exchang guidanc for error and forgiv for punishment. how patient they are in pursuit of the fire!
2|176|that is [deserv by them] becaus allah ha sent down the book in truth. and indeed, those who differ over the book are in extrem dissension.
2|177|right is not that you turn your face toward the east or the west, but [true] righteous is [in] one who believ in allah, the last day, the angels, the book, and the prophet and give wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for free slaves; [and who] establish prayer and give zakah; [those who] fulfil their promis when they promise; and [those who] are patient in poverti and hardship and dure battle. those are the one who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous.
2|178|o you who have believed, prescrib for you is legal retribut for those murder - the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the femal for the female. but whoever overlook from hi brother anything, then there should be a suitabl follow-up and payment to him with good conduct. thi is an allevi from your lord and a mercy. but whoever transgress after that will have a pain punishment.
2|179|and there is for you in legal retribut [save of] life, O you [people] of understanding, that you may becom righteous.
2|180|prescrib for you when death approach [any] one of you if he leav wealth [i that he should make] a bequest for the parent and near rel accord to what is accept - a duti upon the righteous.
2|181|then whoever alter the bequest after he ha heard it - the sin is onli upon those who have alter it. indeed, allah is hear and knowing.
2|182|but if one fear from the bequeath [some] error or sin and correct that which is between them, there is no sin upon him. indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
2|183|o you who have believed, decre upon you is fast as it wa decre upon those befor you that you may becom righteou -
2|184|[fast for] a limit number of days. So whoever among you is ill or on a journey [dure them] - then an equal number of day [are to be made up]. and upon those who are abl [to fast, but with hardship] - a ransom [a substitute] of feed a poor person [each day]. and whoever volunt excess - it is better for him. but to fast is best for you, if you onli knew.
2|185|th month of ramadhan [i that] in which wa reveal the qur'an, a guidanc for the peopl and clear proof of guidanc and criterion. So whoever sight [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days. allah intend for you eas and doe not intend for you hardship and [wants] for you to complet the period and to glorifi allah for that [to] which He ha guid you; and perhap you will be grateful.
2|186|and when My servant ask you, [O muhammad], concern Me - inde I am near. I respond to the invoc of the supplic when he call upon me. So let them respond to Me [bi obedience] and believ in Me that they may be [rightly] guided.
2|187|it ha been made permiss for you the night preced fast to go to your wive [for sexual relations]. they are cloth for you and you are cloth for them. allah know that you use to deceiv yourselves, so He accept your repent and forgav you. So now, have relat with them and seek that which allah ha decre for you. and eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becom distinct to you from the black thread [of night]. then complet the fast until the sunset. and do not have relat with them as long as you are stay for worship in the mosques. these are the limit [set by] allah, so do not approach them. thu doe allah make clear hi ordin to the peopl that they may becom righteous.
2|188|and do not consum one another' wealth unjustli or send it [in bribery] to the ruler in order that [they might aid] you [to] consum a portion of the wealth of the peopl in sin, while you know [it is unlawful].
2|189|they ask you, [O muhammad], about the new moons. say, "they are measur of time for the peopl and for hajj." and it is not righteous to enter hous from the back, but righteous is [in] one who fear allah. and enter hous from their doors. and fear allah that you may succeed.
2|190|fight in the way of allah those who fight you but do not transgress. indeed. allah doe not like transgressors.
2|191|and kill them wherev you overtak them and expel them from wherev they have expel you, and fitnah is wors than killing. and do not fight them at al-masjid al- haram until they fight you there. but if they fight you, then kill them. such is the recompens of the disbelievers.
2|192|and if they cease, then indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
2|193|fight them until there is no [more] fitnah and [until] worship is [acknowledg to be] for allah. but if they cease, then there is to be no aggress except against the oppressors.
2|194|[fight in] the sacr month is for [aggress commit in] the sacr month, and for [all] violat is legal retribution. So whoever ha assault you, then assault him in the same way that he ha assault you. and fear allah and know that allah is with those who fear him.
2|195|and spend in the way of allah and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hand into destruct [bi refraining]. and do good; indeed, allah love the doer of good.
2|196|and complet the hajj and 'umrah for allah. but if you are prevented, then [offer] what can be obtain with eas of sacrifici animals. and do not shave your head until the sacrifici anim ha reach it place of slaughter. and whoever among you is ill or ha an ailment of the head [make shave necessari must offer] a ransom of fast [three days] or chariti or sacrifice. and when you are secure, then whoever perform 'umrah [dure the hajj months] follow by hajj [offers] what can be obtain with eas of sacrifici animals. and whoever cannot find [or afford such an animal] - then a fast of three day dure hajj and of seven when you have return [home]. those are ten complet [days]. thi is for those whose famili is not in the area of al-masjid al-haram. and fear allah and know that allah is sever in penalty.
2|197|hajj is [during] well-known months, so whoever ha made hajj obligatori upon himself therein [bi enter the state of ihram], there is [to be for him] no sexual relat and no disobedi and no disput dure hajj. and whatev good you do - allah know it. and take provisions, but indeed, the best provis is fear of allah. and fear me, O you of understanding.
2|198|ther is no blame upon you for seek bounti from your lord [dure hajj]. but when you depart from 'arafat, rememb allah at al- mash'ar al-haram. and rememb him, as He ha guid you, for indeed, you were befor that among those astray.
2|199|then depart from the place from where [all] the peopl depart and ask forgiv of allah. indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
2|200|and when you have complet your rites, rememb allah like your [previous] remembr of your father or with [much] greater remembrance. and among the peopl is he who says, "our lord, give us in thi world," and he will have in the hereaft no share.
2|201|but among them is he who says, "our lord, give us in thi world [that which is] good and in the hereaft [that which is] good and protect us from the punish of the fire."
2|202|thos will have a share of what they have earned, and allah is swift in account.
2|203|and rememb allah dure [specific] number days. then whoever hasten [hi departure] in two day - there is no sin upon him; and whoever delay [until the third] - there is no sin upon him - for him who fear allah. and fear allah and know that unto him you will be gathered.
2|204|and of the peopl is he whose speech pleas you in worldli life, and he call allah to wit as to what is in hi heart, yet he is the fiercest of opponents.
2|205|and when he goe away, he strive throughout the land to caus corrupt therein and destroy crop and animals. and allah doe not like corruption.
2|206|and when it is said to him, "fear allah," pride in the sin take hold of him. suffici for him is hellfire, and how wretch is the rest place.
2|207|and of the peopl is he who sell himself, seek mean to the approv of allah. and allah is kind to [his] servants.
2|208|o you who have believed, enter into islam complet [and perfectly] and do not follow the footstep of satan. indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.
2|209|but if you deviat after clear proof have come to you, then know that allah is exalt in might and wise.
2|210|do they await but that allah should come to them in cover of cloud and the angel [a well] and the matter is [then] decided? and to allah [all] matter are returned.
2|211|ask the children of israel how mani a sign of evid We have given them. and whoever exchang the favor of allah [for disbelief] after it ha come to him - then indeed, allah is sever in penalty.
2|212|beautifi for those who disbeliev is the life of thi world, and they ridicul those who believe. but those who fear allah are abov them on the day of resurrection. and allah give provis to whom He will without account.
2|213|mankind wa [of] one religion [befor their deviation]; then allah sent the prophet as bringer of good tide and warner and sent down with them the scriptur in truth to judg between the peopl concern that in which they differed. and none differ over the scriptur except those who were given it - after the clear proof came to them - out of jealou animos among themselves. and allah guid those who believ to the truth concern that over which they had differed, by hi permission. and allah guid whom He will to a straight path.
2|214|or do you think that you will enter paradis while such [trial] ha not yet come to you as came to those who pass on befor you? they were touch by poverti and hardship and were shaken until [even their] messeng and those who believ with him said, "when is the help of allah?" unquestionably, the help of allah is near.
2|215|they ask you, [O muhammad], what they should spend. say, "whatev you spend of good is [to be] for parent and rel and orphan and the needi and the traveler. and whatev you do of good - indeed, allah is know of it."
2|216|fight ha been enjoin upon you while it is hate to you. but perhap you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhap you love a thing and it is bad for you. and allah knows, while you know not.
2|217|they ask you about the sacr month - about fight therein. say, "fight therein is great [sin], but avert [people] from the way of allah and disbelief in him and [prevent access to] al-masjid al-haram and the expuls of it peopl therefrom are greater [evil] in the sight of allah. and fitnah is greater than killing." and they will continu to fight you until they turn you back from your religion if they are able. and whoever of you revert from hi religion [to disbelief] and die while he is a disbeliev - for those, their deed have becom worthless in thi world and the hereafter, and those are the companion of the fire, they will abid therein eternally.
2|218|indeed, those who have believ and those who have emigr and fought in the caus of allah - those expect the merci of allah. and allah is forgiv and merciful.
2|219|they ask you about wine and gambling. say, "in them is great sin and [yet, some] benefit for people. but their sin is greater than their benefit." and they ask you what they should spend. say, "the excess [beyond needs]." thu allah make clear to you the vers [of revelation] that you might give thought.
2|220|to thi world and the hereafter. and they ask you about orphans. say, "improv for them is best. and if you mix your affair with their - they are your brothers. and allah know the corrupt from the amender. and if allah had willed, He could have put you in difficulty. indeed, allah is exalt in might and wise.
2|221|and do not marri polytheist women until they believe. and a believ slave woman is better than a polytheist, even though she might pleas you. and do not marri polytheist men [to your women] until they believe. and a believ slave is better than a polytheist, even though he might pleas you. those invit [you] to the fire, but allah invit to paradis and to forgiveness, by hi permission. and He make clear hi vers to the peopl that perhap they may remember.

2|230|and if he ha divorc her [for the third time], then she is not law to him afterward until [after] she marri a husband other than him. and if the latter husband divorc her [or dies], there is no blame upon the woman and her former husband for return to each other if they think that they can keep [within] the limit of allah. these are the limit of allah, which He make clear to a peopl who know.
2|231|and when you divorc women and they have [nearly] fulfil their term, either retain them accord to accept term or releas them accord to accept terms, and do not keep them, intend harm, to transgress [against them]. and whoever doe that ha certainli wrong himself. and do not take the vers of allah in jest. and rememb the favor of allah upon you and what ha been reveal to you of the book and wisdom by which He instruct you. and fear allah and know that allah is know of all things.

2|244|and fight in the caus of allah and know that allah is hear and knowing.
2|245|who is it that would loan allah a goodli loan so He may multipli it for him mani time over? and it is allah who withhold and grant abundance, and to him you will be returned.
2|246|hav you not consid the assembl of the children of israel after [the time of] mose when they said to a prophet of theirs, "send to us a king, and we will fight in the way of allah "? He said, "would you perhap refrain from fight if fight wa prescrib for you?" they said, "and whi should we not fight in the caus of allah when we have been driven out from our home and from our children?" but when fight wa prescrib for them, they turn away, except for a few of them. and allah is know of the wrongdoers.
2|247|and their prophet said to them, "indeed, allah ha sent to you saul as a king." they said, "how can he have kingship over us while we are more worthi of kingship than him and he ha not been given ani measur of wealth?" He said, "indeed, allah ha chosen him over you and ha increas him abundantli in knowledg and stature. and allah give hi sovereignti to whom He wills. and allah is all-encompass [in favor] and knowing."
2|248|and their prophet said to them, "indeed, a sign of hi kingship is that the chest will come to you in which is assur from your lord and a remnant of what the famili of mose and the famili of aaron had left, carri by the angels. inde in that is a sign for you, if you are believers."
2|249|and when saul went forth with the soldiers, he said, "indeed, allah will be test you with a river. So whoever drink from it is not of me, and whoever doe not tast it is inde of me, except one who take [from it] in the hollow of hi hand." but they drank from it, except a [very] few of them. then when he had cross it along with those who believ with him, they said, "there is no power for us today against goliath and hi soldiers." but those who were certain that they would meet allah said, "how mani a small compani ha overcom a larg compani by permiss of allah. and allah is with the patient."
2|250|and when they went forth to [face] goliath and hi soldiers, they said, "our lord, pour upon us patienc and plant firmli our feet and give us victori over the disbeliev people."
2|251|so they defeat them by permiss of allah, and david kill goliath, and allah gave him the kingship and prophethood and taught him from that which He willed. and if it were not for allah check [some] peopl by mean of others, the earth would have been corrupted, but allah is full of bounti to the worlds.
2|252|thes are the vers of allah which We recit to you, [O muhammad], in truth. and indeed, you are from among the messengers.
2|253|thos messeng - some of them We caus to exceed others. among them were those to whom allah spoke, and He rais some of them in degree. and We gave jesus, the son of mary, clear proofs, and We support him with the pure spirit. If allah had willed, those [generations] succeed them would not have fought each other after the clear proof had come to them. but they differed, and some of them believ and some of them disbelieved. and if allah had willed, they would not have fought each other, but allah doe what He intends.
2|254|o you who have believed, spend from that which We have provid for you befor there come a day in which there is no exchang and no friendship and no intercession. and the disbeliev - they are the wrongdoers.
2|255|allah - there is no deiti except him, the ever-living, the sustain of [all] existence. neither drowsi overtak him nor sleep. To him belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth. who is it that can interced with him except by hi permission? He know what is [presently] befor them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of hi knowledg except for what He wills. hi kursi extend over the heaven and the earth, and their preserv tire him not. and He is the most high, the most great.
2|256|ther shall be no compuls in [accept of] the religion. the right cours ha becom clear from the wrong. So whoever disbeliev in taghut and believ in allah ha grasp the most trustworthi handhold with no break in it. and allah is hear and knowing.
2|257|allah is the alli of those who believe. He bring them out from dark into the light. and those who disbeliev - their alli are taghut. they take them out of the light into darknesses. those are the companion of the fire; they will abid etern therein.
2|258|hav you not consid the one who argu with abraham about hi lord [merely] becaus allah had given him kingship? when abraham said, "mi lord is the one who give life and caus death," he said, "I give life and caus death." abraham said, "indeed, allah bring up the sun from the east, so bring it up from the west." So the disbeliev wa overwhelm [bi astonishment], and allah doe not guid the wrongdo people.
2|259|or [consid such an example] as the one who pass by a township which had fallen into ruin. He said, "how will allah bring thi to life after it death?" So allah caus him to die for a hundr years; then He reviv him. He said, "how long have you remained?" the man said, "I have remain a day or part of a day." He said, "rather, you have remain one hundr years. look at your food and your drink; it ha not chang with time. and look at your donkey; and We will make you a sign for the people. and look at the bone [of thi donkey] - how We rais them and then We cover them with flesh." and when it becam clear to him, he said, "I know that allah is over all thing competent."
2|260|and [mention] when abraham said, "mi lord, show me how you give life to the dead." [allah] said, "have you not believed?" He said, "yes, but [I ask] onli that my heart may be satisfied." [allah] said, "take four bird and commit them to yourself. then [after slaughter them] put on each hill a portion of them; then call them - they will come [flying] to you in haste. and know that allah is exalt in might and wise."
2|261|th exampl of those who spend their wealth in the way of allah is like a seed [of grain] which grow seven spikes; in each spike is a hundr grains. and allah multipli [hi reward] for whom He wills. and allah is all-encompass and knowing.
2|262|thos who spend their wealth in the way of allah and then do not follow up what they have spent with remind [of it] or [other] injuri will have their reward with their lord, and there will be no fear concern them, nor will they grieve.
2|263|kind speech and forgiv are better than chariti follow by injury. and allah is free of need and forbearing.
2|264|o you who have believed, do not invalid your chariti with remind or injuri as doe one who spend hi wealth [only] to be seen by the peopl and doe not believ in allah and the last day. hi exampl is like that of a [large] smooth stone upon which is dust and is hit by a downpour that leav it bare. they are unabl [to keep] anyth of what they have earned. and allah doe not guid the disbeliev people.
2|265|and the exampl of those who spend their wealth seek mean to the approv of allah and assur [reward for] themselv is like a garden on high ground which is hit by a downpour - so it yield it fruit in double. and [even] if it is not hit by a downpour, then a drizzl [i sufficient]. and allah, of what you do, is seeing.
2|266|would one of you like to have a garden of palm tree and grapevin underneath which river flow in which he ha from everi fruit? but he is afflict with old age and ha weak offspring, and it is hit by a whirlwind contain fire and is burned. thu doe allah make clear to you [his] vers that you might give thought.
2|267|o you who have believed, spend from the good thing which you have earn and from that which We have produc for you from the earth. and do not aim toward the defect therefrom, spend [from that] while you would not take it [yourself] except with close eyes. and know that allah is free of need and praiseworthy.
2|268|satan threaten you with poverti and order you to immorality, while allah promis you forgiv from him and bounty. and allah is all-encompass and knowing.
2|269|h give wisdom to whom He wills, and whoever ha been given wisdom ha certainli been given much good. and none will rememb except those of understanding.
2|270|and whatev you spend of expenditur or make of vow - indeed, allah know of it. and for the wrongdoer there are no helpers.
2|271|if you disclos your charit expenditures, they are good; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, it is better for you, and He will remov from you some of your misde [thereby]. and allah, with what you do, is [fully] acquainted.
2|272|not upon you, [O muhammad], is [respons for] their guidance, but allah guid whom He wills. and whatev good you [believers] spend is for yourselves, and you do not spend except seek the counten of allah. and whatev you spend of good - it will be fulli repaid to you, and you will not be wronged.
2|273|[char is] for the poor who have been restrict for the caus of allah, unabl to move about in the land. An ignor [person] would think them self-suffici becaus of their restraint, but you will know them by their [characteristic] sign. they do not ask peopl persist [or at all]. and whatev you spend of good - indeed, allah is know of it.
2|274|thos who spend their wealth [in allah 's way] by night and by day, secretli and publicli - they will have their reward with their lord. and no fear will there be concern them, nor will they grieve.
2|275|thos who consum interest cannot stand [on the day of resurrection] except as one stand who is be beaten by satan into insanity. that is becaus they say, "trade is [just] like interest." but allah ha permit trade and ha forbidden interest. So whoever ha receiv an admonit from hi lord and desist may have what is past, and hi affair rest with allah. but whoever return to [deal in interest or usury] - those are the companion of the fire; they will abid etern therein.
2|276|allah destroy interest and give increas for charities. and allah doe not like everi sin disbeliever.
2|277|indeed, those who believ and do righteou deed and establish prayer and give zakah will have their reward with their lord, and there will be no fear concern them, nor will they grieve.
2|278|o you who have believed, fear allah and give up what remain [due to you] of interest, if you should be believers.
2|279|and if you do not, then be inform of a war [against you] from allah and hi messenger. but if you repent, you may have your princip - [thus] you do no wrong, nor are you wronged.
2|280|and if someon is in hardship, then [let there be] postpon until [a time of] ease. but if you give [from your right as] charity, then it is better for you, if you onli knew.
2|281|and fear a day when you will be return to allah. then everi soul will be compens for what it earned, and they will not be treat unjustly.
2|282|o you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specifi term, write it down. and let a scribe write [it] between you in justice. let no scribe refus to write as allah ha taught him. So let him write and let the one who ha the oblig dictate. and let him fear allah, hi lord, and not leav anyth out of it. but if the one who ha the oblig is of limit understand or weak or unabl to dictat himself, then let hi guardian dictat in justice. and bring to wit two wit from among your men. and if there are not two men [available], then a man and two women from those whom you accept as wit - so that if one of the women errs, then the other can remind her. and let not the wit refus when they are call upon. and do not be [too] weari to write it, whether it is small or large, for it [specified] term. that is more just in the sight of allah and stronger as evid and more like to prevent doubt between you, except when it is an immedi transact which you conduct among yourselves. for [then] there is no blame upon you if you do not write it. and take wit when you conclud a contract. let no scribe be harm or ani witness. for if you do so, indeed, it is [grave] disobedi in you. and fear allah. and allah teach you. and allah is know of all things.
2|283|and if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then a secur deposit [should be] taken. and if one of you entrust another, then let him who is entrust discharg hi trust [faithfully] and let him fear allah, hi lord. and do not conceal testimony, for whoever conceal it - hi heart is inde sinful, and allah is know of what you do.
2|284|to allah belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is in the earth. whether you show what is within yourselv or conceal it, allah will bring you to account for it. then He will forgiv whom He will and punish whom He wills, and allah is over all thing competent.
2|285|th messeng ha believ in what wa reveal to him from hi lord, and [so have] the believers. all of them have believ in allah and hi angel and hi book and hi messengers, [saying], "we make no distinct between ani of hi messengers." and they say, "we hear and we obey. [we seek] your forgiveness, our lord, and to you is the [final] destination."
2|286|allah doe not charg a soul except [with that within] it capacity. It will have [the consequ of] what [good] it ha gained, and it will bear [the consequ of] what [evil] it ha earned. "our lord, do not impos blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred. our lord, and lay not upon us a burden like that which you laid upon those befor us. our lord, and burden us not with that which we have no abil to bear. and pardon us; and forgiv us; and have merci upon us. you are our protector, so give us victori over the disbeliev people."
3|1|alif, lam, meem.
3|2|allah - there is no deiti except him, the ever-living, the sustain of existence.
3|3|h ha sent down upon you, [O muhammad], the book in truth, confirm what wa befor it. and He reveal the torah and the gospel.
3|4|before, as guidanc for the people. and He reveal the qur'an. indeed, those who disbeliev in the vers of allah will have a sever punishment, and allah is exalt in might, the owner of retribution.
3|5|indeed, from allah noth is hidden in the earth nor in the heaven.
3|6|it is He who form you in the womb howev He wills. there is no deiti except him, the exalt in might, the wise.
3|7|it is He who ha sent down to you, [O muhammad], the book; in it are vers [that are] precis - they are the foundat of the book - and other unspecific. As for those in whose heart is deviat [from truth], they will follow that of it which is unspecific, seek discord and seek an interpret [suitabl to them]. and no one know it [true] interpret except allah. but those firm in knowledg say, "we believ in it. all [of it] is from our lord." and no one will be remind except those of understanding.
3|8|[who say], "our lord, let not our heart deviat after you have guid us and grant us from yourself mercy. indeed, you are the bestower.
3|9|our lord, sure you will gather the peopl for a day about which there is no doubt. indeed, allah doe not fail in hi promise."
3|10|indeed, those who disbeliev - never will their wealth or their children avail them against allah at all. and it is they who are fuel for the fire.
3|11|[their is] like the custom of the peopl of pharaoh and those befor them. they deni our signs, so allah seiz them for their sins. and allah is sever in penalty.
3|12|say to those who disbelieve, "you will be overcom and gather togeth to hell, and wretch is the rest place."
3|13|alreadi there ha been for you a sign in the two armi which met - one fight in the caus of allah and anoth of disbelievers. they saw them [to be] twice their [own] number by [their] eyesight. but allah support with hi victori whom He wills. inde in that is a lesson for those of vision.
3|14|beautifi for peopl is the love of that which they desir - of women and sons, heaped-up sum of gold and silver, fine brand horses, and cattl and till land. that is the enjoy of worldli life, but allah ha with him the best return.
3|15|say, "shall I inform you of [something] better than that? for those who fear allah will be garden in the presenc of their lord beneath which river flow, wherein they abid eternally, and purifi spous and approv from allah. and allah is see of [his] servant -
3|16|those who say, "our lord, inde we have believed, so forgiv us our sin and protect us from the punish of the fire,"
3|17|th patient, the true, the obedient, those who spend [in the way of allah], and those who seek forgiv befor dawn.
3|18|allah wit that there is no deiti except him, and [so do] the angel and those of knowledg - [that He is] maintain [creation] in justice. there is no deiti except him, the exalt in might, the wise.
3|19|indeed, the religion in the sight of allah is islam. and those who were given the scriptur did not differ except after knowledg had come to them - out of jealou animos between themselves. and whoever disbeliev in the vers of allah, then indeed, allah is swift in [taking] account.
3|20|so if they argu with you, say, "I have submit myself to allah [in islam], and [so have] those who follow me." and say to those who were given the scriptur and [to] the unlearned, "have you submit yourselves?" and if they submit [in islam], they are rightli guided; but if they turn away - then upon you is onli the [duti of] notification. and allah is see of [his] servants.
3|21|thos who disbeliev in the sign of allah and kill the prophet without right and kill those who order justic from among the peopl - give them tide of a pain punishment.
3|22|they are the one whose deed have becom worthless in thi world and the hereafter, and for them there will be no helpers.
3|23|do you not consider, [O muhammad], those who were given a portion of the scripture? they are invit to the scriptur of allah that it should arbitr between them; then a parti of them turn away, and they are refusing.
3|24|that is becaus they say, "never will the fire touch us except for [a few] number days," and [because] they were delud in their religion by what they were inventing.
3|25|so how will it be when We assembl them for a day about which there is no doubt? and each soul will be compens [in full for] what it earned, and they will not be wronged.
3|26|say, "O allah, owner of sovereignty, you give sovereignti to whom you will and you take sovereignti away from whom you will. you honor whom you will and you humbl whom you will. In your hand is [all] good. indeed, you are over all thing competent.
3|27|y caus the night to enter the day, and you caus the day to enter the night; and you bring the live out of the dead, and you bring the dead out of the living. and you give provis to whom you will without account."
3|28|let not believ take disbeliev as alli rather than believers. and whoever [of you] doe that ha noth with allah, except when take precaut against them in prudence. and allah warn you of himself, and to allah is the [final] destination.
3|29|say, "whether you conceal what is in your breast or reveal it, allah know it. and He know that which is in the heaven and that which is on the earth. and allah is over all thing competent.
3|30|th day everi soul will find what it ha done of good present [befor it] and what it ha done of evil, it will wish that between itself and that [evil] wa a great distance. and allah warn you of himself, and allah is kind to [his] servants."
3|31|say, [O muhammad], "if you should love allah, then follow me, [so] allah will love you and forgiv you your sins. and allah is forgiv and merciful."
3|32|say, "obey allah and the messenger." but if they turn away - then indeed, allah doe not like the disbelievers.
3|33|indeed, allah chose adam and noah and the famili of abraham and the famili of 'imran over the world -
3|34|descendants, some of them from others. and allah is hear and knowing.
3|35|[mention, O muhammad], when the wife of 'imran said, "mi lord, inde I have pledg to you what is in my womb, consecr [for your service], so accept thi from me. indeed, you are the hearing, the knowing."
3|36|but when she deliv her, she said, "mi lord, I have deliv a female." and allah wa most know of what she delivered, "and the male is not like the female. and I have name her mary, and I seek refug for her in you and [for] her descend from satan, the expel [from the merci of allah]."
3|37|so her lord accept her with good accept and caus her to grow in a good manner and put her in the care of zechariah. everi time zechariah enter upon her in the prayer chamber, he found with her provision. He said, "O mary, from where is thi [coming] to you?" she said, "it is from allah. indeed, allah provid for whom He will without account."
3|38|at that, zechariah call upon hi lord, saying, "mi lord, grant me from yourself a good offspring. indeed, you are the hearer of supplication."
3|39|so the angel call him while he wa stand in prayer in the chamber, "indeed, allah give you good tide of john, confirm a word from allah and [who will be] honorable, abstain [from women], and a prophet from among the righteous."
3|40|h said, "mi lord, how will I have a boy when I have reach old age and my wife is barren?" the angel said, "such is allah; He doe what He wills."
3|41|h said, "mi lord, make for me a sign." He said, "your sign is that you will not [be abl to] speak to the peopl for three day except by gesture. and rememb your lord much and exalt [him with praise] in the even and the morning."
3|42|and [mention] when the angel said, "O mary, inde allah ha chosen you and purifi you and chosen you abov the women of the worlds.
3|43|o mary, be devoutli obedi to your lord and prostrat and bow with those who bow [in prayer]."
3|44|that is from the news of the unseen which We reveal to you, [O muhammad]. and you were not with them when they cast their pen as to which of them should be respons for mary. nor were you with them when they disputed.
3|45|[and mention] when the angel said, "O mary, inde allah give you good tide of a word from him, whose name will be the messiah, jesus, the son of mari - distinguish in thi world and the hereaft and among those brought near [to allah].
3|46|h will speak to the peopl in the cradl and in matur and will be of the righteous."
3|47|sh said, "mi lord, how will I have a child when no man ha touch me?" [the angel] said, "such is allah; He creat what He wills. when He decre a matter, He onli say to it, 'be,' and it is.
3|48|and He will teach him write and wisdom and the torah and the gospel
3|49|and [make him] a messeng to the children of israel, [who will say], 'inde I have come to you with a sign from your lord in that I design for you from clay [that which is] like the form of a bird, then I breath into it and it becom a bird by permiss of allah. and I cure the blind and the leper, and I give life to the dead - by permiss of allah. and I inform you of what you eat and what you store in your houses. inde in that is a sign for you, if you are believers.
3|50|and [I have come] confirm what wa befor me of the torah and to make law for you some of what wa forbidden to you. and I have come to you with a sign from your lord, so fear allah and obey me.
3|51|indeed, allah is my lord and your lord, so worship him. that is the straight path."
3|52|but when jesu felt [persist in] disbelief from them, he said, "who are my support for [the caus of] allah?" the discipl said, "we are support for allah. We have believ in allah and testifi that we are muslim [submit to him].
3|53|our lord, we have believ in what you reveal and have follow the messeng jesus, so regist us among the wit [to truth]."
3|54|and the disbeliev planned, but allah planned. and allah is the best of planners.
3|55|[mention] when allah said, "O jesus, inde I will take you and rais you to myself and purifi you from those who disbeliev and make those who follow you [in submiss to allah alone] superior to those who disbeliev until the day of resurrection. then to Me is your return, and I will judg between you concern that in which you use to differ.
3|56|and as for those who disbelieved, I will punish them with a sever punish in thi world and the hereafter, and they will have no helpers."
3|57|but as for those who believ and did righteou deeds, He will give them in full their rewards, and allah doe not like the wrongdoers.
3|58|thi is what We recit to you, [O muhammad], of [our] vers and the precis [and wise] message.
3|59|indeed, the exampl of jesu to allah is like that of adam. He creat him from dust; then He said to him, "be," and he was.
3|60|th truth is from your lord, so do not be among the doubters.
3|61|then whoever argu with you about it after [this] knowledg ha come to you - say, "come, let us call our son and your sons, our women and your women, ourselv and yourselves, then supplic earnestli [together] and invok the curs of allah upon the liar [among us]."
3|62|indeed, thi is the true narration. and there is no deiti except allah. and indeed, allah is the exalt in might, the wise.
3|63|but if they turn away, then inde - allah is know of the corrupters.
3|64|say, "O peopl of the scripture, come to a word that is equit between us and you - that we will not worship except allah and not associ anyth with him and not take one anoth as lord instead of allah." but if they turn away, then say, "bear wit that we are muslim [submit to him]."
3|65|o peopl of the scripture, whi do you argu about abraham while the torah and the gospel were not reveal until after him? then will you not reason?
3|66|her you are - those who have argu about that of which you have [some] knowledge, but whi do you argu about that of which you have no knowledge? and allah knows, while you know not.
3|67|abraham wa neither a jew nor a christian, but he wa one inclin toward truth, a muslim [submit to allah]. and he wa not of the polytheists.
3|68|indeed, the most worthi of abraham among the peopl are those who follow him [in submiss to allah] and thi prophet, and those who believ [in hi message]. and allah is the alli of the believers.
3|69|a faction of the peopl of the scriptur wish they could mislead you. but they do not mislead except themselves, and they perceiv [it] not.
3|70|o peopl of the scripture, whi do you disbeliev in the vers of allah while you wit [to their truth]?
3|71|o peopl of the scripture, whi do you confus the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know [it]?
3|72|and a faction of the peopl of the scriptur say [to each other], "believ in that which wa reveal to the believ at the begin of the day and reject it at it end that perhap they will abandon their religion,
3|73|and do not trust except those who follow your religion." say, "indeed, the [true] guidanc is the guidanc of allah. [do you fear] lest someon be given [knowledge] like you were given or that they would [thereby] argu with you befor your lord?" say, "indeed, [all] bounti is in the hand of allah - He grant it to whom He wills. and allah is all-encompass and wise."
3|74|h select for hi merci whom He wills. and allah is the possessor of great bounty.
3|75|and among the peopl of the scriptur is he who, if you entrust him with a great amount [of wealth], he will return it to you. and among them is he who, if you entrust him with a [single] silver coin, he will not return it to you unless you are constantli stand over him [demand it]. that is becaus they say, "there is no blame upon us concern the unlearned." and they speak untruth about allah while they know [it].
3|76|but yes, whoever fulfil hi commit and fear allah - then indeed, allah love those who fear him.
3|77|indeed, those who exchang the coven of allah and their [own] oath for a small price will have no share in the hereafter, and allah will not speak to them or look at them on the day of resurrection, nor will He purifi them; and they will have a pain punishment.
3|78|and indeed, there is among them a parti who alter the scriptur with their tongu so you may think it is from the scripture, but it is not from the scripture. and they say, "thi is from allah," but it is not from allah. and they speak untruth about allah while they know.
3|79|it is not for a human [prophet] that allah should give him the scriptur and author and prophethood and then he would say to the people, "be servant to me rather than allah," but [instead, he would say], "be piou scholar of the lord becaus of what you have taught of the scriptur and becaus of what you have studied."
3|80|nor could he order you to take the angel and prophet as lords. would he order you to disbelief after you had been muslims?
3|81|and [recall, O peopl of the scripture], when allah took the coven of the prophets, [saying], "whatev I give you of the scriptur and wisdom and then there come to you a messeng confirm what is with you, you [must] believ in him and support him." [allah] said, "have you acknowledg and taken upon that My commitment?" they said, "we have acknowledg it." He said, "then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses."
3|82|and whoever turn away after that - they were the defiantli disobedient.
3|83|so is it other than the religion of allah they desire, while to him have submit [all] those within the heaven and earth, willingli or by compulsion, and to him they will be returned?
3|84|say, "we have believ in allah and in what wa reveal to us and what wa reveal to abraham, ishmael, isaac, jacob, and the descendants, and in what wa given to mose and jesu and to the prophet from their lord. We make no distinct between ani of them, and we are muslim [submitting] to him."
3|85|and whoever desir other than islam as religion - never will it be accept from him, and he, in the hereafter, will be among the losers.
3|86|how shall allah guid a peopl who disbeliev after their belief and had wit that the messeng is true and clear sign had come to them? and allah doe not guid the wrongdo people.
3|87|thos - their recompens will be that upon them is the curs of allah and the angel and the people, all together,
3|88|abid etern therein. the punish will not be lighten for them, nor will they be reprieved.
3|89|except for those who repent after that and correct themselves. for indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
3|90|indeed, those who reject the messag after their belief and then increas in disbelief - never will their [claimed] repent be accepted, and they are the one astray.
3|91|indeed, those who disbeliev and die while they are disbeliev - never would the [whole] capac of the earth in gold be accept from one of them if he would [seek to] ransom himself with it. for those there will be a pain punishment, and they will have no helpers.
3|92|nev will you attain the good [reward] until you spend [in the way of allah] from that which you love. and whatev you spend - indeed, allah is know of it.
3|93|al food wa law to the children of israel except what israel had made unlaw to himself befor the torah wa revealed. say, [O muhammad], "so bring the torah and recit it, if you should be truthful."
3|94|and whoever invent about allah untruth after that - then those are [truly] the wrongdoers.
3|95|say, "allah ha told the truth. So follow the religion of abraham, inclin toward truth; and he wa not of the polytheists."
3|96|indeed, the first hous [of worship] establish for mankind wa that at makkah - bless and a guidanc for the worlds.
3|97|in it are clear sign [such as] the stand place of abraham. and whoever enter it shall be safe. and [due] to allah from the peopl is a pilgrimag to the hous - for whoever is abl to find thereto a way. but whoever disbeliev - then indeed, allah is free from need of the worlds.
3|98|say, "O peopl of the scripture, whi do you disbeliev in the vers of allah while allah is wit over what you do?"
3|99|say, "O peopl of the scripture, whi do you avert from the way of allah those who believe, seek to make it [seem] deviant, while you are wit [to the truth]? and allah is not unawar of what you do."
3|100|o you who have believed, if you obey a parti of those who were given the scripture, they would turn you back, after your belief, [to being] unbelievers.
3|101|and how could you disbeliev while to you are be recit the vers of allah and among you is hi messenger? and whoever hold firmli to allah ha [indeed] been guid to a straight path.
3|102|o you who have believed, fear allah as He should be fear and do not die except as muslim [in submiss to him].
3|103|and hold firmli to the rope of allah all togeth and do not becom divided. and rememb the favor of allah upon you - when you were enemi and He brought your heart togeth and you became, by hi favor, brothers. and you were on the edg of a pit of the fire, and He save you from it. thu doe allah make clear to you hi vers that you may be guided.
3|104|and let there be [arising] from you a nation invit to [all that is] good, enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and those will be the successful.
3|105|and do not be like the one who becam divid and differ after the clear proof had come to them. and those will have a great punishment.
3|106|on the day [some] face will turn white and [some] face will turn black. As for those whose face turn black, [to them it will be said], "did you disbeliev after your belief? then tast the punish for what you use to reject."
3|107|but as for those whose face will turn white, [they will be] within the merci of allah. they will abid therein eternally.
3|108|thes are the vers of allah. We recit them to you, [O muhammad], in truth; and allah want no injustic to the worlds.
3|109|to allah belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth. and to allah will [all] matter be returned.
3|110|y are the best nation produc [a an example] for mankind. you enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believ in allah. If onli the peopl of the scriptur had believed, it would have been better for them. among them are believers, but most of them are defiantli disobedient.
3|111|they will not harm you except for [some] annoyance. and if they fight you, they will show you their backs; then they will not be aided.
3|112|they have been put under humili [bi allah] wherev they are overtaken, except for a coven from allah and a rope from the muslims. and they have drawn upon themselv anger from allah and have been put under destitution. that is becaus they disbeliev in the vers of allah and kill the prophet without right. that is becaus they disobey and [habitually] transgressed.
3|113|they are not [all] the same; among the peopl of the scriptur is a commun stand [in obedience], recit the vers of allah dure period of the night and prostrat [in prayer].
3|114|they believ in allah and the last day, and they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and hasten to good deeds. and those are among the righteous.
3|115|and whatev good they do - never will it be remov from them. and allah is know of the righteous.
3|116|indeed, those who disbeliev - never will their wealth or their children avail them against allah at all, and those are the companion of the fire; they will abid therein eternally.
3|117|th exampl of what they spend in thi worldli life is like that of a wind contain frost which strike the harvest of a peopl who have wrong themselv and destroy it. and allah ha not wrong them, but they wrong themselves.
3|118|o you who have believed, do not take as intim those other than yourselves, for they will not spare you [any] ruin. they wish you would have hardship. hatr ha alreadi appear from their mouths, and what their breast conceal is greater. We have certainli made clear to you the signs, if you will use reason.
3|119|her you are love them but they are not love you, while you believ in the scriptur - all of it. and when they meet you, they say, "we believe." but when they are alone, they bite their fingertip at you in rage. say, "die in your rage. indeed, allah is know of that within the breasts."
3|120|if good touch you, it distress them; but if harm strike you, they rejoic at it. and if you are patient and fear allah, their plot will not harm you at all. indeed, allah is encompass of what they do.
3|121|and [remember] when you, [O muhammad], left your famili in the morn to post the believ at their station for the battl [of uhud] - and allah is hear and know -
3|122|when two parti among you were about to lose courage, but allah wa their ally; and upon allah the believ should rely.
3|123|and alreadi had allah given you victori at [the battl of] badr while you were few in number. then fear allah; perhap you will be grateful.
3|124|[remember] when you said to the believers, "i it not suffici for you that your lord should reinforc you with three thousand angel sent down?
3|125|yes, if you remain patient and consciou of allah and the enemi come upon you [attacking] in rage, your lord will reinforc you with five thousand angel have mark [of distinction]
3|126|and allah made it not except as [a sign of] good tide for you and to reassur your heart thereby. and victori is not except from allah, the exalt in might, the wise -
3|127|that He might cut down a section of the disbeliev or suppress them so that they turn back disappointed.
3|128|not for you, [O muhammad, but for allah], is the decis whether He should [cut them down] or forgiv them or punish them, for indeed, they are wrongdoers.
3|129|and to allah belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth. He forgiv whom He will and punish whom He wills. and allah is forgiv and merciful.
3|130|o you who have believed, do not consum usury, doubl and multiplied, but fear allah that you may be successful.
3|131|and fear the fire, which ha been prepar for the disbelievers.
3|132|and obey allah and the messeng that you may obtain mercy.
3|133|and hasten to forgiv from your lord and a garden as wide as the heaven and earth, prepar for the righteous
3|134|who spend [in the caus of allah] dure eas and hardship and who restrain anger and who pardon the peopl - and allah love the doer of good;
3|135|and those who, when they commit an immor or wrong themselv [bi transgression], rememb allah and seek forgiv for their sin - and who can forgiv sin except allah? - and [who] do not persist in what they have done while they know.
3|136|thos - their reward is forgiv from their lord and garden beneath which river flow [in paradise], wherein they will abid eternally; and excel is the reward of the [righteous] workers.
3|137|similar situat [a yours] have pass on befor you, so proceed throughout the earth and observ how wa the end of those who denied.
3|138|thi [qur'an] is a clear statement to [all] the peopl and a guidanc and instruct for those consciou of allah.
3|139|so do not weaken and do not grieve, and you will be superior if you are [true] believers.
3|140|if a wound should touch you - there ha alreadi touch the [opposing] peopl a wound similar to it. and these day [of vari conditions] We altern among the peopl so that allah may make evid those who believ and [may] take to himself from among you martyr - and allah doe not like the wrongdoer -
3|141|and that allah may purifi the believ [through trials] and destroy the disbelievers.
3|142|or do you think that you will enter paradis while allah ha not yet made evid those of you who fight in hi caus and made evid those who are steadfast?
3|143|and you had certainli wish for martyrdom befor you encount it, and you have [now] seen it [befor you] while you were look on.
3|144|muhammad is not but a messenger. [other] messeng have pass on befor him. So if he wa to die or be killed, would you turn back on your heel [to unbelief]? and he who turn back on hi heel will never harm allah at all; but allah will reward the grateful.
3|145|and it is not [possible] for one to die except by permiss of allah at a decre determined. and whoever desir the reward of thi world - We will give him thereof; and whoever desir the reward of the hereaft - We will give him thereof. and we will reward the grateful.
3|146|and how mani a prophet [fought and] with him fought mani religi scholars. but they never lost assur due to what afflict them in the caus of allah, nor did they weaken or submit. and allah love the steadfast.
3|147|and their word were not but that they said, "our lord, forgiv us our sin and the excess [committed] in our affair and plant firmli our feet and give us victori over the disbeliev people."
3|148|so allah gave them the reward of thi world and the good reward of the hereafter. and allah love the doer of good.
3|149|o you who have believed, if you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back on your heels, and you will [then] becom losers.
3|150|but allah is your protector, and He is the best of helpers.
3|151|w will cast terror into the heart of those who disbeliev for what they have associ with allah of which He had not sent down [any] authority. and their refug will be the fire, and wretch is the resid of the wrongdoers.
3|152|and allah had certainli fulfil hi promis to you when you were kill the enemi by hi permiss until [the time] when you lost courag and fell to disput about the order [given by the prophet] and disobey after He had shown you that which you love. among you are some who desir thi world, and among you are some who desir the hereafter. then he turn you back from them [defeated] that He might test you. and He ha alreadi forgiven you, and allah is the possessor of bounti for the believers.
3|153|[remember] when you [fled and] climb [the mountain] without look asid at anyon while the messeng wa call you from behind. So allah repaid you with distress upon distress so you would not griev for that which had escap you [of victori and spoil of war] or [for] that which had befallen you [of injuri and death]. and allah is [fully] acquaint with what you do.
3|154|then after distress, He sent down upon you secur [in the form of] drowsiness, overcom a faction of you, while anoth faction worri about themselves, think of allah other than the truth - the thought of ignorance, saying, "i there anyth for us [to have done] in thi matter?" say, "indeed, the matter belong complet to allah." they conceal within themselv what they will not reveal to you. they say, "if there wa anyth we could have done in the matter, some of us would not have been kill right here." say, "even if you had been insid your houses, those decre to be kill would have come out to their death beds." [it was] so that allah might test what is in your breast and purifi what is in your hearts. and allah is know of that within the breasts.
3|155|indeed, those of you who turn back on the day the two armi met, it wa satan who caus them to slip becaus of some [blame] they had earned. but allah ha alreadi forgiven them. indeed, allah is forgiv and forbearing.
3|156|o you who have believed, do not be like those who disbeliev and said about their brother when they travel through the land or went out to fight, "if they had been with us, they would not have die or have been killed," so allah make that [misconception] a regret within their hearts. and it is allah who give life and caus death, and allah is see of what you do.
3|157|and if you are kill in the caus of allah or die - then forgiv from allah and merci are better than whatev they accumul [in thi world].
3|158|and whether you die or are killed, unto allah you will be gathered.
3|159|so by merci from allah, [O muhammad], you were lenient with them. and if you had been rude [in speech] and harsh in heart, they would have disband from about you. So pardon them and ask forgiv for them and consult them in the matter. and when you have decided, then reli upon allah. indeed, allah love those who reli [upon him].
3|160|if allah should aid you, no one can overcom you; but if He should forsak you, who is there that can aid you after him? and upon allah let the believ rely.
3|161|it is not [attributable] to ani prophet that he would act unfaith [in regard to war booty]. and whoever betrays, [take unlawfully], will come with what he took on the day of resurrection. then will everi soul be [fully] compens for what it earned, and they will not be wronged.
3|162|so is one who pursu the pleasur of allah like one who bring upon himself the anger of allah and whose refug is hell? and wretch is the destination.
3|163|they are [varying] degre in the sight of allah, and allah is see of whatev they do.
3|164|certainli did allah confer [great] favor upon the believ when He sent among them a messeng from themselves, recit to them hi vers and purifi them and teach them the book and wisdom, although they had been befor in manifest error.
3|165|whi [i it that] when a [single] disast struck you [on the day of uhud], although you had struck [the enemi in the battl of badr] with one twice as great, you said, "from where is this?" say, "it is from yourselves." indeed, allah is over all thing competent.
3|166|and what struck you on the day the two armi met wa by permiss of allah that He might make evid the [true] believers.
3|167|and that He might make evid those who are hypocrites. for it wa said to them, "come, fight in the way of allah or [at least] defend." they said, "if we had known [there would be] fighting, we would have follow you." they were nearer to disbelief that day than to faith, say with their mouth what wa not in their hearts. and allah is most know of what they conceal -
3|168|those who said about their brother while sit [at home], "if they had obey us, they would not have been killed." say, "then prevent death from yourselves, if you should be truthful."
3|169|and never think of those who have been kill in the caus of allah as dead. rather, they are aliv with their lord, receiv provision,
3|170|rejo in what allah ha bestow upon them of hi bounty, and they receiv good tide about those [to be martyred] after them who have not yet join them - that there will be no fear concern them, nor will they grieve.
3|171|they receiv good tide of favor from allah and bounti and [of the fact] that allah doe not allow the reward of believ to be lost -
3|172|those [believers] who respond to allah and the messeng after injuri had struck them. for those who did good among them and fear allah is a great reward -
3|173|those to whom hypocrit said, "indeed, the peopl have gather against you, so fear them." but it [merely] increas them in faith, and they said, "suffici for us is allah, and [he is] the best dispos of affairs."
3|174|so they return with favor from allah and bounty, no harm have touch them. and they pursu the pleasur of allah, and allah is the possessor of great bounty.
3|175|that is onli satan who frighten [you] of hi supporters. So fear them not, but fear me, if you are [indeed] believers.
3|176|and do not be grieved, [O muhammad], by those who hasten into disbelief. indeed, they will never harm allah at all. allah intend that He should give them no share in the hereafter, and for them is a great punishment.
3|177|indeed, those who purchas disbelief [in exchange] for faith - never will they harm allah at all, and for them is a pain punishment.
3|178|and let not those who disbeliev ever think that [because] We extend their time [of enjoyment] it is better for them. We onli extend it for them so that they may increas in sin, and for them is a humili punishment.
3|179|allah would not leav the believ in that [state] you are in [presently] until He separ the evil from the good. nor would allah reveal to you the unseen. but [instead], allah choos of hi messeng whom He wills, so believ in allah and hi messengers. and if you believ and fear him, then for you is a great reward.
3|180|and let not those who [greedily] withhold what allah ha given them of hi bounti ever think that it is better for them. rather, it is wors for them. their neck will be encircl by what they withheld on the day of resurrection. and to allah belong the heritag of the heaven and the earth. and allah, with what you do, is [fully] acquainted.
3|181|allah ha certainli heard the statement of those [jews] who said, "indeed, allah is poor, while we are rich." We will record what they said and their kill of the prophet without right and will say, "tast the punish of the burn fire.
3|182|that is for what your hand have put forth and becaus allah is not ever unjust to [his] servants."
3|183|[they are] those who said, "indeed, allah ha taken our promis not to believ ani messeng until he bring us an offer which fire [from heaven] will consume." say, "there have alreadi come to you messeng befor me with clear proof and [even] that of which you speak. So whi did you kill them, if you should be truthful?"
3|184|then if they deni you, [O muhammad] - so were messeng deni befor you, who brought clear proof and written ordin and the enlighten scripture.
3|185|everi soul will tast death, and you will onli be given your [full] compens on the day of resurrection. So he who is drawn away from the fire and admit to paradis ha attain [hi desire]. and what is the life of thi world except the enjoy of delusion.
3|186|y will sure be test in your possess and in yourselves. and you will sure hear from those who were given the scriptur befor you and from those who associ other with allah much abuse. but if you are patient and fear allah - indeed, that is of the matter [worthy] of determination.
3|187|and [mention, O muhammad], when allah took a coven from those who were given the scripture, [saying], "you must make it clear to the peopl and not conceal it." but they threw it away behind their back and exchang it for a small price. and wretch is that which they purchased.
3|188|and never think that those who rejoic in what they have perpetr and like to be prais for what they did not do - never think them [to be] in safeti from the punishment, and for them is a pain punishment.
3|189|and to allah belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth, and allah is over all thing competent.
3|190|indeed, in the creation of the heaven and the earth and the altern of the night and the day are sign for those of understanding.
3|191|who rememb allah while stand or sit or [lying] on their side and give thought to the creation of the heaven and the earth, [saying], "our lord, you did not creat thi aimlessly; exalt are you [abov such a thing]; then protect us from the punish of the fire.
3|192|our lord, inde whoever you admit to the fire - you have disgrac him, and for the wrongdoer there are no helpers.
3|193|our lord, inde we have heard a caller call to faith, [saying], 'believ in your lord,' and we have believed. our lord, so forgiv us our sin and remov from us our misde and caus us to die with the righteous.
3|194|our lord, and grant us what you promis us through your messeng and do not disgrac us on the day of resurrection. indeed, you do not fail in [your] promise."
3|195|and their lord respond to them, "never will I allow to be lost the work of [any] worker among you, whether male or female; you are of one another. So those who emigr or were evict from their home or were harm in My caus or fought or were kill - I will sure remov from them their misdeeds, and I will sure admit them to garden beneath which river flow as reward from allah, and allah ha with him the best reward."
3|196|b not deceiv by the [uninhibited] movement of the disbeliev throughout the land.
3|197|[it is but] a small enjoyment; then their [final] refug is hell, and wretch is the rest place.
3|198|but those who fear their lord will have garden beneath which river flow, abid etern therein, as accommod from allah. and that which is with allah is best for the righteous.
3|199|and indeed, among the peopl of the scriptur are those who believ in allah and what wa reveal to you and what wa reveal to them, [being] humbl submiss to allah. they do not exchang the vers of allah for a small price. those will have their reward with their lord. indeed, allah is swift in account.
3|200|o you who have believed, persever and endur and remain station and fear allah that you may be successful.
4|1|o mankind, fear your lord, who creat you from one soul and creat from it it mate and dispers from both of them mani men and women. and fear allah, through whom you ask one another, and the wombs. inde allah is ever, over you, an observer.
4|2|and give to the orphan their properti and do not substitut the defect [of your own] for the good [of theirs]. and do not consum their properti into your own. indeed, that is ever a great sin.
4|3|and if you fear that you will not deal justli with the orphan girls, then marri those that pleas you of [other] women, two or three or four. but if you fear that you will not be just, then [marri only] one or those your right hand possesses. that is more suitabl that you may not inclin [to injustice].
4|4|and give the women [upon marriage] their [bridal] gift graciously. but if they give up willingli to you anyth of it, then take it in satisfact and ease.
4|5|and do not give the weak-mind your property, which allah ha made a mean of susten for you, but provid for them with it and cloth them and speak to them word of appropri kindness.
4|6|and test the orphan [in their abilities] until they reach marriag age. then if you perceiv in them sound judgement, releas their properti to them. and do not consum it excess and quickly, [anticipating] that they will grow up. and whoever, [when act as guardian], is self-suffici should refrain [from take a fee]; and whoever is poor - let him take accord to what is acceptable. then when you releas their properti to them, bring wit upon them. and suffici is allah as accountant.
4|7|for men is a share of what the parent and close rel leave, and for women is a share of what the parent and close rel leave, be it littl or much - an obligatori share.
4|8|and when [other] rel and orphan and the needi are present at the [time of] division, then provid for them [something] out of the estat and speak to them word of appropri kindness.
4|9|and let those [executor and guardians] fear [injustice] as if they [themselves] had left weak offspr behind and fear for them. So let them fear allah and speak word of appropri justice.
4|10|indeed, those who devour the properti of orphan unjustli are onli consum into their belli fire. and they will be burn in a blaze.
4|11|allah instruct you concern your children: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females. but if there are [only] daughters, two or more, for them is two third of one' estate. and if there is onli one, for her is half. and for one' parents, to each one of them is a sixth of hi estat if he left children. but if he had no children and the parent [alone] inherit from him, then for hi mother is one third. and if he had brother [or sisters], for hi mother is a sixth, after ani bequest he [may have] made or debt. your parent or your children - you know not which of them are nearest to you in benefit. [these share are] an oblig [imposed] by allah. indeed, allah is ever know and wise.
4|12|and for you is half of what your wive leav if they have no child. but if they have a child, for you is one fourth of what they leave, after ani bequest they [may have] made or debt. and for the wive is one fourth if you leav no child. but if you leav a child, then for them is an eighth of what you leave, after ani bequest you [may have] made or debt. and if a man or woman leav neither ascend nor descend but ha a brother or a sister, then for each one of them is a sixth. but if they are more than two, they share a third, after ani bequest which wa made or debt, as long as there is no detriment [caused]. [thi is] an ordin from allah, and allah is know and forbearing.
4|13|thes are the limit [set by] allah, and whoever obey allah and hi messeng will be admit by him to garden [in paradise] under which river flow, abid etern therein; and that is the great attainment.
4|14|and whoever disobey allah and hi messeng and transgress hi limit - He will put him into the fire to abid etern therein, and he will have a humili punishment.
4|15|thos who commit unlaw sexual intercours of your women - bring against them four [witnesses] from among you. and if they testify, confin the guilti women to hous until death take them or allah ordain for them [another] way.
4|16|and the two who commit it among you, dishonor them both. but if they repent and correct themselves, leav them alone. indeed, allah is ever accept of repent and merciful.
4|17|th repent accept by allah is onli for those who do wrong in ignor [or carelessness] and then repent soon after. It is those to whom allah will turn in forgiveness, and allah is ever know and wise.
4|18|but repent is not [accepted] of those who [continu to] do evil deed up until, when death come to one of them, he says, "indeed, I have repent now," or of those who die while they are disbelievers. for them We have prepar a pain punishment.
4|19|o you who have believed, it is not law for you to inherit women by compulsion. and do not make difficulti for them in order to take [back] part of what you gave them unless they commit a clear immorality. and live with them in kindness. for if you dislik them - perhap you dislik a thing and allah make therein much good.
4|20|but if you want to replac one wife with anoth and you have given one of them a great amount [in gifts], do not take [back] from it anything. would you take it in injustic and manifest sin?
4|21|and how could you take it while you have gone in unto each other and they have taken from you a solemn covenant?
4|22|and do not marri those [women] whom your father married, except what ha alreadi occurred. indeed, it wa an immor and hate [to allah] and wa evil as a way.
4|23|prohibit to you [for marriage] are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your father' sisters, your mother' sisters, your brother' daughters, your sister' daughters, your [milk] mother who nurs you, your sister through nursing, your wives' mothers, and your step-daught under your guardianship [born] of your wive unto whom you have gone in. but if you have not gone in unto them, there is no sin upon you. and [also prohibit are] the wive of your son who are from your [own] loins, and that you take [in marriage] two sister simultaneously, except for what ha alreadi occurred. indeed, allah is ever forgiv and merciful.
4|24|and [also prohibit to you are all] marri women except those your right hand possess. [thi is] the decre of allah upon you. and law to you are [all others] beyond these, [provided] that you seek them [in marriage] with [gift from] your property, desir chastity, not unlaw sexual intercourse. So for whatev you enjoy [of marriage] from them, give them their due compens as an obligation. and there is no blame upon you for what you mutual agre to beyond the obligation. indeed, allah is ever know and wise.
4|25|and whoever among you cannot [find] the mean to marri free, believ women, then [he may marry] from those whom your right hand possess of believ slave girls. and allah is most know about your faith. you [believers] are of one another. So marri them with the permiss of their peopl and give them their due compens accord to what is acceptable. [they should be] chaste, neither [of] those who commit unlaw intercours randomli nor those who take [secret] lovers. but onc they are shelter in marriage, if they should commit adultery, then for them is half the punish for free [unmarried] women. thi [allowance] is for him among you who fear sin, but to be patient is better for you. and allah is forgiv and merciful.
4|26|allah want to make clear to you [the law from the unlawful] and guid you to the [good] practic of those befor you and to accept your repentance. and allah is know and wise.
4|27|allah want to accept your repentance, but those who follow [their] passion want you to digress [into] a great deviation.
4|28|and allah want to lighten for you [your difficulties]; and mankind wa creat weak.
4|29|o you who have believed, do not consum one another' wealth unjustli but onli [in lawful] busi by mutual consent. and do not kill yourselv [or one another]. indeed, allah is to you ever merciful.
4|30|and whoever doe that in aggress and injustic - then We will drive him into a fire. and that, for allah, is [always] easy.
4|31|if you avoid the major sin which you are forbidden, We will remov from you your lesser sin and admit you to a nobl entranc [into paradise].
4|32|and do not wish for that by which allah ha made some of you exceed others. for men is a share of what they have earned, and for women is a share of what they have earned. and ask allah of hi bounty. inde allah is ever, of all things, knowing.
4|33|and for all, We have made heir to what is left by parent and relatives. and to those whom your oath have bound [to you] - give them their share. inde allah is ever, over all things, a witness.
4|34|men are in charg of women by [right of] what allah ha given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteou women are devoutli obedient, guard in [the husband's] absenc what allah would have them guard. but those [wives] from whom you fear arrog - [first] advis them; [then if they persist], forsak them in bed; and [finally], strike them. but if they obey you [onc more], seek no mean against them. indeed, allah is ever exalt and grand.
4|35|and if you fear dissens between the two, send an arbitr from hi peopl and an arbitr from her people. If they both desir reconciliation, allah will caus it between them. indeed, allah is ever know and acquaint [with all things].
4|36|worship allah and associ noth with him, and to parent do good, and to relatives, orphans, the needy, the near neighbor, the neighbor farther away, the companion at your side, the traveler, and those whom your right hand possess. indeed, allah doe not like those who are self-delud and boastful.
4|37|who are stingi and enjoin upon [other] peopl stingi and conceal what allah ha given them of hi bounti - and We have prepar for the disbeliev a humili punish -
4|38|and [also] those who spend of their wealth to be seen by the peopl and believ not in allah nor in the last day. and he to whom satan is a companion - then evil is he as a companion.
4|39|and what [harm would come] upon them if they believ in allah and the last day and spent out of what allah provid for them? and allah is ever, about them, knowing.
4|40|indeed, allah doe not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom' weight; while if there is a good deed, He multipli it and give from himself a great reward.
4|41|so how [will it be] when We bring from everi nation a wit and we bring you, [O muhammad] against these [people] as a witness?
4|42|that day, those who disbeliev and disobey the messeng will wish they could be cover by the earth. and they will not conceal from allah a [single] statement.
4|43|o you who have believed, do not approach prayer while you are intox until you know what you are say or in a state of janabah, except those pass through [a place of prayer], until you have wash [your whole body]. and if you are ill or on a journey or one of you come from the place of reliev himself or you have contact women and find no water, then seek clean earth and wipe over your face and your hand [with it]. indeed, allah is ever pardon and forgiving.
4|44|hav you not seen those who were given a portion of the scripture, purchas error [in exchang for it] and wish you would lose the way?
4|45|and allah is most know of your enemies; and suffici is allah as an ally, and suffici is allah as a helper.
4|46|among the jew are those who distort word from their [proper] usag and say, "we hear and disobey" and "hear but be not heard" and "ra'ina," twist their tongu and defam the religion. and if they had said [instead], "we hear and obey" and "wait for us [to understand]," it would have been better for them and more suitable. but allah ha curs them for their disbelief, so they believ not, except for a few.
4|47|o you who were given the scripture, believ in what We have sent down [to muhammad], confirm that which is with you, befor We obliter face and turn them toward their back or curs them as We curs the sabbath-breakers. and ever is the decre of allah accomplished.
4|48|indeed, allah doe not forgiv associ with him, but He forgiv what is less than that for whom He wills. and he who associ other with allah ha certainli fabric a tremend sin.
4|49|hav you not seen those who claim themselv to be pure? rather, allah purifi whom He wills, and injustic is not done to them, [even] as much as a thread [insid a date seed].
4|50|look how they invent about allah untruth, and suffici is that as a manifest sin.
4|51|hav you not seen those who were given a portion of the scripture, who believ in superstit and fals object of worship and say about the disbelievers, "these are better guid than the believ as to the way"?
4|52|thos are the one whom allah ha cursed; and he whom allah curs - never will you find for him a helper.
4|53|or have they a share of dominion? then [if that were so], they would not give the peopl [even as much as] the speck on a date seed.
4|54|or do they envi peopl for what allah ha given them of hi bounty? but we had alreadi given the famili of abraham the scriptur and wisdom and confer upon them a great kingdom.
4|55|and some among them believ in it, and some among them were avers to it. and suffici is hell as a blaze.
4|56|indeed, those who disbeliev in our vers - We will drive them into a fire. everi time their skin are roast through We will replac them with other skin so they may tast the punishment. indeed, allah is ever exalt in might and wise.
4|57|but those who believ and do righteou deed - We will admit them to garden beneath which river flow, wherein they abid forever. for them therein are purifi spouses, and We will admit them to deepen shade.
4|58|indeed, allah command you to render trust to whom they are due and when you judg between peopl to judg with justice. excel is that which allah instruct you. indeed, allah is ever hear and seeing.
4|59|o you who have believed, obey allah and obey the messeng and those in author among you. and if you disagre over anything, refer it to allah and the messenger, if you should believ in allah and the last day. that is the best [way] and best in result.
4|60|hav you not seen those who claim to have believ in what wa reveal to you, [O muhammad], and what wa reveal befor you? they wish to refer legisl to taghut, while they were command to reject it; and satan wish to lead them far astray.
4|61|and when it is said to them, "come to what allah ha reveal and to the messenger," you see the hypocrit turn away from you in aversion.
4|62|so how [will it be] when disast strike them becaus of what their hand have put forth and then they come to you swear by allah, "we intend noth but good conduct and accommodation."
4|63|thos are the one of whom allah know what is in their hearts, so turn away from them but admonish them and speak to them a far-reach word.
4|64|and We did not send ani messeng except to be obey by permiss of allah. and if, when they wrong themselves, they had come to you, [O muhammad], and ask forgiv of allah and the messeng had ask forgiv for them, they would have found allah accept of repent and merciful.
4|65|but no, by your lord, they will not [truly] believ until they make you, [O muhammad], judg concern that over which they disput among themselv and then find within themselv no discomfort from what you have judg and submit in [full, willing] submission.
4|66|and if We had decre upon them, "kill yourselves" or "leav your homes," they would not have done it, except for a few of them. but if they had done what they were instructed, it would have been better for them and a firmer posit [for them in faith].
4|67|and then We would have given them from Us a great reward.
4|68|and We would have guid them to a straight path.
4|69|and whoever obey allah and the messeng - those will be with the one upon whom allah ha bestow favor of the prophets, the steadfast affirm of truth, the martyr and the righteous. and excel are those as companions.
4|70|that is the bounti from allah, and suffici is allah as knower.
4|71|o you who have believed, take your precaut and [either] go forth in compani or go forth all together.
4|72|and indeed, there is among you he who linger behind; and if disast strike you, he says, "allah ha favor me in that I wa not present with them."
4|73|but if bounti come to you from allah, he will sure say, as if there had never been between you and him ani affection. "oh, I wish I had been with them so I could have attain a great attainment."
4|74|so let those fight in the caus of allah who sell the life of thi world for the hereafter. and he who fight in the caus of allah and is kill or achiev victori - We will bestow upon him a great reward.
4|75|and what is [the matter] with you that you fight not in the caus of allah and [for] the oppress among men, women, and children who say, "our lord, take us out of thi citi of oppress peopl and appoint for us from yourself a protector and appoint for us from yourself a helper?"
4|76|thos who believ fight in the caus of allah, and those who disbeliev fight in the caus of taghut. So fight against the alli of satan. indeed, the plot of satan ha ever been weak.
4|77|hav you not seen those who were told, "restrain your hand [from fighting] and establish prayer and give zakah"? but then when fight wa ordain for them, at onc a parti of them fear men as they fear allah or with [even] greater fear. they said, "our lord, whi have you decre upon us fighting? If onli you had postpon [it for] us for a short time." say, the enjoy of thi world is little, and the hereaft is better for he who fear allah. and injustic will not be done to you, [even] as much as a thread [insid a date seed]."
4|78|wherev you may be, death will overtak you, even if you should be within tower of lofti construction. but if good come to them, they say, "thi is from allah "; and if evil befal them, they say, "thi is from you." say, "all [things] are from allah." So what is [the matter] with those peopl that they can hardli understand ani statement?
4|79|what come to you of good is from allah, but what come to you of evil, [O man], is from yourself. and We have sent you, [O muhammad], to the peopl as a messenger, and suffici is allah as witness.
4|80|h who obey the messeng ha obey allah; but those who turn away - We have not sent you over them as a guardian.
4|81|and they say, "[we pledge] obedience." but when they leav you, a group of them spend the night determin to do other than what you say. but allah record what they plan by night. So leav them alon and reli upon allah. and suffici is allah as dispos of affairs.
4|82|then do they not reflect upon the qur'an? If it had been from [any] other than allah, they would have found within it much contradiction.
4|83|and when there come to them inform about [public] secur or fear, they spread it around. but if they had refer it back to the messeng or to those of author among them, then the one who [can] draw correct conclus from it would have known about it. and if not for the favor of allah upon you and hi mercy, you would have follow satan, except for a few.
4|84|so fight, [O muhammad], in the caus of allah; you are not held respons except for yourself. and encourag the believ [to join you] that perhap allah will restrain the [military] might of those who disbelieve. and allah is greater in might and stronger in [exemplary] punishment.
4|85|whoev interced for a good caus will have a reward therefrom; and whoever interced for an evil caus will have a burden therefrom. and ever is allah, over all things, a keeper.
4|86|and when you are greet with a greeting, greet [in return] with one better than it or [at least] return it [in a like manner]. indeed, allah is ever, over all things, an accountant.
4|87|allah - there is no deiti except him. He will sure assembl you for [account on] the day of resurrection, about which there is no doubt. and who is more truth than allah in statement.
4|88|what is [the matter] with you [that you are] two group concern the hypocrites, while allah ha made them fall back [into error and disbelief] for what they earned. Do you wish to guid those whom allah ha sent astray? and he whom allah send astray - never will you find for him a way [of guidance].
4|89|they wish you would disbeliev as they disbeliev so you would be alike. So do not take from among them alli until they emigr for the caus of allah. but if they turn away, then seiz them and kill them wherev you find them and take not from among them ani alli or helper.
4|90|except for those who take refug with a peopl between yourselv and whom is a treati or those who come to you, their heart strain at [the prospect of] fight you or fight their own people. and if allah had willed, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. So if they remov themselv from you and do not fight you and offer you peace, then allah ha not made for you a caus [for fighting] against them.
4|91|you will find other who wish to obtain secur from you and [to] obtain secur from their people. everi time they are return to [the influenc of] disbelief, they fall back into it. So if they do not withdraw from you or offer you peac or restrain their hands, then seiz them and kill them wherev you overtak them. and those - We have made for you against them a clear authorization.
4|92|and never is it for a believ to kill a believ except by mistake. and whoever kill a believ by mistak - then the free of a believ slave and a compens payment present to the deceased' famili [i required] unless they give [up their right as] charity. but if the deceas wa from a peopl at war with you and he wa a believ - then [only] the free of a believ slave; and if he wa from a peopl with whom you have a treati - then a compens payment present to hi famili and the free of a believ slave. and whoever doe not find [one or cannot afford to buy one] - then [instead], a fast for two month consecutively, [seeking] accept of repent from allah. and allah is ever know and wise.
4|93|but whoever kill a believ intent - hi recompens is hell, wherein he will abid eternally, and allah ha becom angri with him and ha curs him and ha prepar for him a great punishment.
4|94|o you who have believed, when you go forth [to fight] in the caus of allah, investigate; and do not say to one who give you [a greet of] peac "you are not a believer," aspir for the good of worldli life; for with allah are mani acquisitions. you [yourselves] were like that before; then allah confer hi favor upon you, so investigate. inde allah is ever, with what you do, acquainted.
4|95|not equal are those believ remain [at home] - other than the disabl - and the mujahideen, [who strive and fight] in the caus of allah with their wealth and their lives. allah ha prefer the mujahideen through their wealth and their live over those who remain [behind], by degrees. and to both allah ha promis the best [reward]. but allah ha prefer the mujahideen over those who remain [behind] with a great reward -
4|96|degre [of high position] from him and forgiv and mercy. and allah is ever forgiv and merciful.
4|97|indeed, those whom the angel take [in death] while wrong themselv - [the angels] will say, "in what [condition] were you?" they will say, "we were oppress in the land." the angel will say, "wa not the earth of allah spaciou [enough] for you to emigr therein?" for those, their refug is hell - and evil it is as a destination.
4|98|except for the oppress among men, women and children who cannot devis a plan nor are they direct to a way -
4|99|for those it is expect that allah will pardon them, and allah is ever pardon and forgiving.
4|100|and whoever emigr for the caus of allah will find on the earth mani [alternative] locat and abundance. and whoever leav hi home as an emigr to allah and hi messeng and then death overtak him - hi reward ha alreadi becom incumb upon allah. and allah is ever forgiv and merciful.
4|101|and when you travel throughout the land, there is no blame upon you for shorten the prayer, [especially] if you fear that those who disbeliev may disrupt [or attack] you. indeed, the disbeliev are ever to you a clear enemy.
4|102|and when you are among them and lead them in prayer, let a group of them stand [in prayer] with you and let them carri their arms. and when they have prostrated, let them be [in position] behind you and have the other group come forward which ha not [yet] pray and let them pray with you, take precaut and carri their arms. those who disbeliev wish that you would neglect your weapon and your baggag so they could come down upon you in one [single] attack. but there is no blame upon you, if you are troubl by rain or are ill, for put down your arms, but take precaution. indeed, allah ha prepar for the disbeliev a humili punishment.
4|103|and when you have complet the prayer, rememb allah standing, sitting, or [lying] on your sides. but when you becom secure, re-establish [regular] prayer. indeed, prayer ha been decre upon the believ a decre of specifi times.
4|104|and do not weaken in pursuit of the enemy. If you should be suffer - so are they suffer as you are suffering, but you expect from allah that which they expect not. and allah is ever know and wise.
4|105|indeed, We have reveal to you, [O muhammad], the book in truth so you may judg between the peopl by that which allah ha shown you. and do not be for the deceit an advocate.
4|106|and seek forgiv of allah. indeed, allah is ever forgiv and merciful.
4|107|and do not argu on behalf of those who deceiv themselves. indeed, allah love not one who is a habitu sin deceiver.
4|108|they conceal [their evil intent and deeds] from the people, but they cannot conceal [them] from allah, and He is with them [in hi knowledge] when they spend the night in such as He doe not accept of speech. and ever is allah, of what they do, encompassing.
4|109|her you are - those who argu on their behalf in [this] worldli life - but who will argu with allah for them on the day of resurrection, or who will [then] be their representative?
4|110|and whoever doe a wrong or wrong himself but then seek forgiv of allah will find allah forgiv and merciful.
4|111|and whoever commit a sin onli earn it against himself. and allah is ever know and wise.
4|112|but whoever earn an offens or a sin and then blame it on an innoc [person] ha taken upon himself a slander and manifest sin.
4|113|and if it wa not for the favor of allah upon you, [O muhammad], and hi mercy, a group of them would have determin to mislead you. but they do not mislead except themselves, and they will not harm you at all. and allah ha reveal to you the book and wisdom and ha taught you that which you did not know. and ever ha the favor of allah upon you been great.
4|114|no good is there in much of their privat conversation, except for those who enjoin chariti or that which is right or concili between people. and whoever doe that seek mean to the approv of allah - then We are go to give him a great reward.
4|115|and whoever oppos the messeng after guidanc ha becom clear to him and follow other than the way of the believ - We will give him what he ha taken and drive him into hell, and evil it is as a destination.
4|116|indeed, allah doe not forgiv associ with him, but He forgiv what is less than that for whom He wills. and he who associ other with allah ha certainli gone far astray.
4|117|they call upon instead of him none but femal [deities], and they [actually] call upon none but a rebelli satan.
4|118|whom allah ha cursed. for he had said, "I will sure take from among your servant a specif portion.
4|119|and I will mislead them, and I will arous in them [sinful] desires, and I will command them so they will slit the ear of cattle, and I will command them so they will chang the creation of allah." and whoever take satan as an alli instead of allah ha certainli sustain a clear loss.
4|120|satan promis them and arous desir in them. but satan doe not promis them except delusion.
4|121|th refug of those will be hell, and they will not find from it an escape.
4|122|but the one who believ and do righteou deed - We will admit them to garden beneath which river flow, wherein they will abid forever. [it is] the promis of allah, [which is] truth, and who is more truth than allah in statement.
4|123|paradis is not [obtained] by your wish think nor by that of the peopl of the scripture. whoever doe a wrong will be recompens for it, and he will not find besid allah a protector or a helper.
4|124|and whoever doe righteou deeds, whether male or female, while be a believ - those will enter paradis and will not be wronged, [even as much as] the speck on a date seed.
4|125|and who is better in religion than one who submit himself to allah while be a doer of good and follow the religion of abraham, inclin toward truth? and allah took abraham as an intim friend.
4|126|and to allah belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth. and ever is allah, of all things, encompassing.
4|127|and they request from you, [O muhammad], a [legal] rule concern women. say, "allah give you a rule about them and [about] what ha been recit to you in the book concern the orphan girl to whom you do not give what is decre for them - and [yet] you desir to marri them - and concern the oppress among children and that you maintain for orphan [their rights] in justice." and whatev you do of good - indeed, allah is ever know of it.
4|128|and if a woman fear from her husband contempt or evasion, there is no sin upon them if they make term of settlement between them - and settlement is best. and present in [human] soul is stinginess. but if you do good and fear allah - then inde allah is ever, with what you do, acquainted.
4|129|and you will never be abl to be equal [in feeling] between wives, even if you should strive [to do so]. So do not inclin complet [toward one] and leav anoth hanging. and if you amend [your affairs] and fear allah - then indeed, allah is ever forgiv and merciful.
4|130|but if they separ [bi divorce], allah will enrich each [of them] from hi abundance. and ever is allah encompass and wise.
4|131|and to allah belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth. and We have instruct those who were given the scriptur befor you and yourselv to fear allah. but if you disbeliev - then to allah belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth. and ever is allah free of need and praiseworthy.
4|132|and to allah belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth. and suffici is allah as dispos of affairs.
4|133|if He wills, He can do away with you, O people, and bring other [in your place]. and ever is allah compet to do that.
4|134|whoev desir the reward of thi world - then with allah is the reward of thi world and the hereafter. and ever is allah hear and seeing.
4|135|o you who have believed, be persist stand firm in justice, wit for allah, even if it be against yourselv or parent and relatives. whether one is rich or poor, allah is more worthi of both. So follow not [personal] inclination, lest you not be just. and if you distort [your testimony] or refus [to give it], then inde allah is ever, with what you do, acquainted.
4|136|o you who have believed, believ in allah and hi messeng and the book that He sent down upon hi messeng and the scriptur which He sent down before. and whoever disbeliev in allah, hi angels, hi books, hi messengers, and the last day ha certainli gone far astray.
4|137|indeed, those who have believ then disbelieved, then believed, then disbelieved, and then increas in disbelief - never will allah forgiv them, nor will He guid them to a way.
4|138|giv tide to the hypocrit that there is for them a pain punish -
4|139|those who take disbeliev as alli instead of the believers. Do they seek with them honor [through power]? but indeed, honor belong to allah entirely.
4|140|and it ha alreadi come down to you in the book that when you hear the vers of allah [recited], they are deni [bi them] and ridiculed; so do not sit with them until they enter into anoth conversation. indeed, you would then be like them. inde allah will gather the hypocrit and disbeliev in hell all togeth -
4|141|those who wait [and watch] you. then if you gain a victori from allah, they say, "were we not with you?" but if the disbeliev have a success, they say [to them], "did we not gain the advantag over you, but we protect you from the believers?" allah will judg between [all of] you on the day of resurrection, and never will allah give the disbeliev over the believ a way [to overcom them].
4|142|indeed, the hypocrit [think to] deceiv allah, but He is deceiv them. and when they stand for prayer, they stand lazily, show [themselv to] the peopl and not rememb allah except a little,
4|143|wav between them, [belonging] neither to the believ nor to the disbelievers. and whoever allah leav astray - never will you find for him a way.
4|144|o you who have believed, do not take the disbeliev as alli instead of the believers. Do you wish to give allah against yourselv a clear case?
4|145|indeed, the hypocrit will be in the lowest depth of the fire - and never will you find for them a helper -
4|146|except for those who repent, correct themselves, hold fast to allah, and are sincer in their religion for allah, for those will be with the believers. and allah is go to give the believ a great reward.
4|147|what would allah do with your punish if you are grate and believe? and ever is allah appreci and knowing.
4|148|allah doe not like the public mention of evil except by one who ha been wronged. and ever is allah hear and knowing.
4|149|if [instead] you show [some] good or conceal it or pardon an offens - indeed, allah is ever pardon and competent.
4|150|indeed, those who disbeliev in allah and hi messeng and wish to discrimin between allah and hi messeng and say, "we believ in some and disbeliev in others," and wish to adopt a way in between -
4|151|those are the disbelievers, truly. and We have prepar for the disbeliev a humili punishment.
4|152|but they who believ in allah and hi messeng and do not discrimin between ani of them - to those He is go to give their rewards. and ever is allah forgiv and merciful.
4|153|th peopl of the scriptur ask you to bring down to them a book from the heaven. but they had ask of mose [even] greater than that and said, "show us allah outright," so the thunderbolt struck them for their wrongdoing. then they took the calf [for worship] after clear evid had come to them, and We pardon that. and We gave mose a clear authority.
4|154|and We rais over them the mount for [refus of] their covenant; and We said to them, "enter the gate bow humbly", and We said to them, "do not transgress on the sabbath", and We took from them a solemn covenant.
4|155|and [we curs them] for their break of the coven and their disbelief in the sign of allah and their kill of the prophet without right and their saying, "our heart are wrapped". rather, allah ha seal them becaus of their disbelief, so they believ not, except for a few.
4|156|and [we curs them] for their disbelief and their say against mari a great slander,
4|157|and [for] their saying, "indeed, we have kill the messiah, jesus, the son of mary, the messeng of allah." and they did not kill him, nor did they crucifi him; but [another] wa made to resembl him to them. and indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. they have no knowledg of it except the follow of assumption. and they did not kill him, for certain.
4|158|rather, allah rais him to himself. and ever is allah exalt in might and wise.
4|159|and there is none from the peopl of the scriptur but that he will sure believ in jesu befor hi death. and on the day of resurrect he will be against them a witness.
4|160|for wrongdo on the part of the jews, We made unlaw for them [certain] good food which had been law to them, and for their avert from the way of allah mani [people],
4|161|and [for] their take of usuri while they had been forbidden from it, and their consum of the people' wealth unjustly. and we have prepar for the disbeliev among them a pain punishment.
4|162|but those firm in knowledg among them and the believ believ in what ha been reveal to you, [O muhammad], and what wa reveal befor you. and the establish of prayer [especially] and the giver of zakah and the believ in allah and the last day - those We will give a great reward.
4|163|indeed, We have reveal to you, [O muhammad], as We reveal to noah and the prophet after him. and we reveal to abraham, ishmael, isaac, jacob, the descendants, jesus, job, jonah, aaron, and solomon, and to david We gave the book [of psalms].
4|164|and [we sent] messeng about whom We have relat [their stories] to you befor and messeng about whom We have not relat to you. and allah spoke to mose with [direct] speech.
4|165|[w sent] messeng as bringer of good tide and warner so that mankind will have no argument against allah after the messengers. and ever is allah exalt in might and wise.
4|166|but allah bear wit to that which He ha reveal to you. He ha sent it down with hi knowledge, and the angel bear wit [a well]. and suffici is allah as witness.
4|167|indeed, those who disbeliev and avert [people] from the way of allah have certainli gone far astray.
4|168|indeed, those who disbeliev and commit wrong [or injustice] - never will allah forgiv them, nor will He guid them to a path.
4|169|except the path of hell; they will abid therein forever. and that, for allah, is [always] easy.
4|170|o mankind, the messeng ha come to you with the truth from your lord, so believe; it is better for you. but if you disbeliev - then indeed, to allah belong whatev is in the heaven and earth. and ever is allah know and wise.
4|171|o peopl of the scripture, do not commit excess in your religion or say about allah except the truth. the messiah, jesus, the son of mary, wa but a messeng of allah and hi word which He direct to mari and a soul [creat at a command] from him. So believ in allah and hi messengers. and do not say, "three"; desist - it is better for you. indeed, allah is but one god. exalt is He abov have a son. To him belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth. and suffici is allah as dispos of affairs.
4|172|nev would the messiah disdain to be a servant of allah, nor would the angel near [to him]. and whoever disdain hi worship and is arrog - He will gather them to himself all together.
4|173|and as for those who believ and did righteou deeds, He will give them in full their reward and grant them extra from hi bounty. but as for those who disdain and were arrogant, He will punish them with a pain punishment, and they will not find for themselv besid allah ani protector or helper.
4|174|o mankind, there ha come to you a conclus proof from your lord, and We have sent down to you a clear light.
4|175|so those who believ in allah and hold fast to him - He will admit them to merci from himself and bounti and guid them to himself on a straight path.
4|176|they request from you a [legal] ruling. say, "allah give you a rule concern one have neither descend nor ascend [a heirs]." If a man dies, leav no child but [only] a sister, she will have half of what he left. and he inherit from her if she [di and] ha no child. but if there are two sister [or more], they will have two-third of what he left. If there are both brother and sisters, the male will have the share of two females. allah make clear to you [hi law], lest you go astray. and allah is know of all things.
5|1|o you who have believed, fulfil [all] contracts. law for you are the anim of graze livestock except for that which is recit to you [in thi qur'an] - hunt not be permit while you are in the state of ihram. indeed, allah ordain what He intends.
5|2|o you who have believed, do not violat the rite of allah or [the sanctiti of] the sacr month or [neglect the mark of] the sacrifici anim and garland [them] or [violat the safeti of] those come to the sacr hous seek bounti from their lord and [his] approval. but when you come out of ihram, then [you may] hunt. and do not let the hatr of a peopl for have obstruct you from al-masjid al-haram lead you to transgress. and cooper in righteous and piety, but do not cooper in sin and aggression. and fear allah; indeed, allah is sever in penalty.
5|3|prohibit to you are dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which ha been dedic to other than allah, and [those animals] kill by strangl or by a violent blow or by a head-long fall or by the gore of horns, and those from which a wild anim ha eaten, except what you [are abl to] slaughter [befor it death], and those which are sacrif on stone altars, and [prohibit is] that you seek decis through divin arrows. that is grave disobedience. thi day those who disbeliev have despair of [defeating] your religion; so fear them not, but fear me. thi day I have perfect for you your religion and complet My favor upon you and have approv for you islam as religion. but whoever is forc by sever hunger with no inclin to sin - then indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
5|4|they ask you, [O muhammad], what ha been made law for them. say, "law for you are [all] good food and [game caught by] what you have train of hunt anim which you train as allah ha taught you. So eat of what they catch for you, and mention the name of allah upon it, and fear allah." indeed, allah is swift in account.
5|5|thi day [all] good food have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the scriptur is law for you and your food is law for them. and [law in marriag are] chast women from among the believ and chast women from among those who were given the scriptur befor you, when you have given them their due compensation, desir chastity, not unlaw sexual intercours or take [secret] lovers. and whoever deni the faith - hi work ha becom worthless, and he, in the hereafter, will be among the losers.
5|6|o you who have believed, when you rise to [perform] prayer, wash your face and your forearm to the elbow and wipe over your head and wash your feet to the ankles. and if you are in a state of janabah, then purifi yourselves. but if you are ill or on a journey or one of you come from the place of reliev himself or you have contact women and do not find water, then seek clean earth and wipe over your face and hand with it. allah doe not intend to make difficulti for you, but He intend to purifi you and complet hi favor upon you that you may be grateful.
5|7|and rememb the favor of allah upon you and hi coven with which He bound you when you said, "we hear and we obey"; and fear allah. indeed, allah is know of that within the breasts.
5|8|o you who have believed, be persist stand firm for allah, wit in justice, and do not let the hatr of a peopl prevent you from be just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness. and fear allah; indeed, allah is acquaint with what you do.
5|9|allah ha promis those who believ and do righteou deed [that] for them there is forgiv and great reward.
5|10|but those who disbeliev and deni our sign - those are the companion of hellfire.
5|11|o you who have believed, rememb the favor of allah upon you when a peopl determin to extend their hand [in aggression] against you, but He withheld their hand from you; and fear allah. and upon allah let the believ rely.
5|12|and allah had alreadi taken a coven from the children of israel, and We deleg from among them twelv leaders. and allah said, "I am with you. If you establish prayer and give zakah and believ in My messeng and support them and loan allah a goodli loan, I will sure remov from you your misde and admit you to garden beneath which river flow. but whoever of you disbeliev after that ha certainli stray from the sound of the way."
5|13|so for their break of the coven We curs them and made their heart hard. they distort word from their [proper] usag and have forgotten a portion of that of which they were reminded. and you will still observ deceit among them, except a few of them. but pardon them and overlook [their misdeeds]. indeed, allah love the doer of good.
5|14|and from those who say, "we are christians" We took their covenant; but they forgot a portion of that of which they were reminded. So We caus among them animos and hatr until the day of resurrection. and allah is go to inform them about what they use to do.
5|15|o peopl of the scripture, there ha come to you our messeng make clear to you much of what you use to conceal of the scriptur and overlook much. there ha come to you from allah a light and a clear book.
5|16|bi which allah guid those who pursu hi pleasur to the way of peac and bring them out from dark into the light, by hi permission, and guid them to a straight path.
5|17|they have certainli disbeliev who say that allah is christ, the son of mary. say, "then who could prevent allah at all if He had intend to destroy christ, the son of mary, or hi mother or everyon on the earth?" and to allah belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth and whatev is between them. He creat what He wills, and allah is over all thing competent.
5|18|but the jew and the christian say, "we are the children of allah and hi beloved." say, "then whi doe He punish you for your sins?" rather, you are human be from among those He ha created. He forgiv whom He wills, and He punish whom He wills. and to allah belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth and whatev is between them, and to him is the [final] destination.
5|19|o peopl of the scripture, there ha come to you our messeng to make clear to you [the religion] after a period [of suspension] of messengers, lest you say, "there came not to us ani bringer of good tide or a warner." but there ha come to you a bringer of good tide and a warner. and allah is over all thing competent.
5|20|and [mention, O muhammad], when mose said to hi people, "O my people, rememb the favor of allah upon you when He appoint among you prophet and made you possessor and gave you that which He had not given anyon among the worlds.
5|21|o my people, enter the holi land which allah ha assign to you and do not turn back [from fight in allah 's cause] and [thus] becom losers."
5|22|they said, "O moses, inde within it is a peopl of tyrann strength, and indeed, we will never enter it until they leav it; but if they leav it, then we will enter."
5|23|said two men from those who fear [to disobey] upon whom allah had bestow favor, "enter upon them through the gate, for when you have enter it, you will be predominant. and upon allah rely, if you should be believers."
5|24|they said, "O moses, inde we will not enter it, ever, as long as they are within it; so go, you and your lord, and fight. indeed, we are remain right here."
5|25|[moses] said, "mi lord, inde I do not possess except myself and my brother, so part us from the defiantli disobedi people."
5|26|[allah] said, "then indeed, it is forbidden to them for forti year [in which] they will wander throughout the land. So do not griev over the defiantli disobedi people."
5|27|and recit to them the stori of adam' two sons, in truth, when they both offer a sacrific [to allah], and it wa accept from one of them but wa not accept from the other. said [the latter], "I will sure kill you." said [the former], "indeed, allah onli accept from the righteou [who fear him].
5|28|if you should rais your hand against me to kill me - I shall not rais my hand against you to kill you. indeed, I fear allah, lord of the worlds.
5|29|inde I want you to obtain [thereby] my sin and your sin so you will be among the companion of the fire. and that is the recompens of wrongdoers."
5|30|and hi soul permit to him the murder of hi brother, so he kill him and becam among the losers.
5|31|then allah sent a crow search in the ground to show him how to hide the disgrac of hi brother. He said, "O woe to me! have I fail to be like thi crow and hide the bodi of my brother?" and he becam of the regretful.
5|32|becaus of that, We decre upon the children of israel that whoever kill a soul unless for a soul or for corrupt [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. and whoever save one - it is as if he had save mankind entirely. and our messeng had certainli come to them with clear proofs. then inde mani of them, [even] after that, throughout the land, were transgressors.
5|33|indeed, the penalti for those who wage war against allah and hi messeng and strive upon earth [to cause] corrupt is none but that they be kill or crucifi or that their hand and feet be cut off from opposit side or that they be exil from the land. that is for them a disgrac in thi world; and for them in the hereaft is a great punishment,
5|34|except for those who return [repenting] befor you apprehend them. and know that allah is forgiv and merciful.
5|35|o you who have believed, fear allah and seek the mean [of nearness] to him and strive in hi caus that you may succeed.
5|36|indeed, those who disbeliev - if they should have all that is in the earth and the like of it with it by which to ransom themselv from the punish of the day of resurrection, it will not be accept from them, and for them is a pain punishment
5|37|they will wish to get out of the fire, but never are they to emerg therefrom, and for them is an endur punishment.
5|38|[a for] the thief, the male and the female, amput their hand in recompens for what they commit as a deterr [punishment] from allah. and allah is exalt in might and wise.
5|39|but whoever repent after hi wrongdo and reforms, indeed, allah will turn to him in forgiveness. indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
5|40|do you not know that to allah belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth? He punish whom He will and forgiv whom He wills, and allah is over all thing competent.
5|41|o messenger, let them not griev you who hasten into disbelief of those who say, "we believe" with their mouths, but their heart believ not, and from among the jews. [they are] avid listen to falsehood, listen to anoth peopl who have not come to you. they distort word beyond their [proper] usages, say "if you are given this, take it; but if you are not given it, then beware." but he for whom allah intend fitnah - never will you possess [power to do] for him a thing against allah. those are the one for whom allah doe not intend to purifi their hearts. for them in thi world is disgrace, and for them in the hereaft is a great punishment.
5|42|[they are] avid listen to falsehood, devour of [what is] unlawful. So if they come to you, [O muhammad], judg between them or turn away from them. and if you turn away from them - never will they harm you at all. and if you judge, judg between them with justice. indeed, allah love those who act justly.
5|43|but how is it that they come to you for judgement while they have the torah, in which is the judgement of allah? then they turn away, [even] after that; but those are not [in fact] believers.
5|44|indeed, We sent down the torah, in which wa guidanc and light. the prophet who submit [to allah] judg by it for the jews, as did the rabbi and scholar by that with which they were entrust of the scriptur of allah, and they were wit thereto. So do not fear the peopl but fear me, and do not exchang My vers for a small price. and whoever doe not judg by what allah ha reveal - then it is those who are the disbelievers.
5|45|and We ordain for them therein a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and for wound is legal retribution. but whoever give [up hi right as] charity, it is an expiat for him. and whoever doe not judg by what allah ha reveal - then it is those who are the wrongdoers.
5|46|and We sent, follow in their footsteps, jesus, the son of mary, confirm that which came befor him in the torah; and We gave him the gospel, in which wa guidanc and light and confirm that which preced it of the torah as guidanc and instruct for the righteous.
5|47|and let the peopl of the gospel judg by what allah ha reveal therein. and whoever doe not judg by what allah ha reveal - then it is those who are the defiantli disobedient.
5|48|and We have reveal to you, [O muhammad], the book in truth, confirm that which preced it of the scriptur and as a criterion over it. So judg between them by what allah ha reveal and do not follow their inclin away from what ha come to you of the truth. To each of you We prescrib a law and a method. had allah willed, He would have made you one nation [unit in religion], but [he intended] to test you in what He ha given you; so race to [all that is] good. To allah is your return all together, and He will [then] inform you concern that over which you use to differ.
5|49|and judge, [O muhammad], between them by what allah ha reveal and do not follow their inclin and bewar of them, lest they tempt you away from some of what allah ha reveal to you. and if they turn away - then know that allah onli intend to afflict them with some of their [own] sins. and indeed, mani among the peopl are defiantli disobedient.
5|50|then is it the judgement of [the time of] ignor they desire? but who is better than allah in judgement for a peopl who are certain [in faith].
5|51|o you who have believed, do not take the jew and the christian as allies. they are [in fact] alli of one another. and whoever is an alli to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them. indeed, allah guid not the wrongdo people.
5|52|so you see those in whose heart is diseas hasten into [associ with] them, saying, "we are afraid a misfortun may strike us." but perhap allah will bring conquest or a decis from him, and they will become, over what they have been conceal within themselves, regretful.
5|53|and those who believ will say, "are these the one who swore by allah their strongest oath that inde they were with you?" their deed have becom worthless, and they have becom losers.
5|54|o you who have believed, whoever of you should revert from hi religion - allah will bring forth [in place of them] a peopl He will love and who will love him [who are] humbl toward the believers, power against the disbelievers; they strive in the caus of allah and do not fear the blame of a critic. that is the favor of allah; He bestow it upon whom He wills. and allah is all-encompass and knowing.
5|55|your alli is none but allah and [therefore] hi messeng and those who have believ - those who establish prayer and give zakah, and they bow [in worship].
5|56|and whoever is an alli of allah and hi messeng and those who have believ - indeed, the parti of allah - they will be the predominant.
5|57|o you who have believed, take not those who have taken your religion in ridicul and amus among the one who were given the scriptur befor you nor the disbeliev as allies. and fear allah, if you should [truly] be believers.
5|58|and when you call to prayer, they take it in ridicul and amusement. that is becaus they are a peopl who do not use reason.
5|59|say, "O peopl of the scripture, do you resent us except [for the fact] that we have believ in allah and what wa reveal to us and what wa reveal befor and becaus most of you are defiantli disobedient?"
5|60|say, "shall I inform you of [what is] wors than that as penalti from allah? [it is that of] those whom allah ha curs and with whom He becam angri and made of them ape and pig and slave of taghut. those are wors in posit and further astray from the sound way."
5|61|and when they come to you, they say, "we believe." but they have enter with disbelief [in their hearts], and they have certainli left with it. and allah is most know of what they were concealing.
5|62|and you see mani of them hasten into sin and aggress and the devour of [what is] unlawful. how wretch is what they have been doing.
5|63|whi do the rabbi and religi scholar not forbid them from say what is sin and devour what is unlawful? how wretch is what they have been practicing.
5|64|and the jew say, "the hand of allah is chained." chain are their hands, and curs are they for what they say. rather, both hi hand are extended; He spend howev He wills. and that which ha been reveal to you from your lord will sure increas mani of them in transgress and disbelief. and We have cast among them animos and hatr until the day of resurrection. everi time they kindl the fire of war [against you], allah extinguish it. and they strive throughout the land [causing] corruption, and allah doe not like corrupters.
5|65|and if onli the peopl of the scriptur had believ and fear allah, We would have remov from them their misde and admit them to garden of pleasure.
5|66|and if onli they upheld [the law of] the torah, the gospel, and what ha been reveal to them from their lord, they would have consum [provision] from abov them and from beneath their feet. among them are a moder community, but mani of them - evil is that which they do.
5|67|o messenger, announc that which ha been reveal to you from your lord, and if you do not, then you have not convey hi message. and allah will protect you from the people. indeed, allah doe not guid the disbeliev people.
5|68|say, "O peopl of the scripture, you are [standing] on noth until you uphold [the law of] the torah, the gospel, and what ha been reveal to you from your lord." and that which ha been reveal to you from your lord will sure increas mani of them in transgress and disbelief. So do not griev over the disbeliev people.
5|69|indeed, those who have believ [in prophet muhammad] and those [befor him] who were jew or sabean or christian - those [among them] who believ in allah and the last day and did righteous - no fear will there be concern them, nor will they grieve.
5|70|w had alreadi taken the coven of the children of israel and had sent to them messengers. whenev there came to them a messeng with what their soul did not desire, a parti [of messengers] they denied, and anoth parti they killed.
5|71|and they thought there would be no [resulting] punishment, so they becam blind and deaf. then allah turn to them in forgiveness; then [again] mani of them becam blind and deaf. and allah is see of what they do.
5|72|they have certainli disbeliev who say, "allah is the messiah, the son of mary" while the messiah ha said, "O children of israel, worship allah, my lord and your lord." indeed, he who associ other with allah - allah ha forbidden him paradise, and hi refug is the fire. and there are not for the wrongdoer ani helpers.
5|73|they have certainli disbeliev who say, "allah is the third of three." and there is no god except one god. and if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will sure afflict the disbeliev among them a pain punishment.
5|74|so will they not repent to allah and seek hi forgiveness? and allah is forgiv and merciful.
5|75|th messiah, son of mary, wa not but a messenger; [other] messeng have pass on befor him. and hi mother wa a support of truth. they both use to eat food. look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded.
5|76|say, "do you worship besid allah that which hold for you no [power of] harm or benefit while it is allah who is the hearing, the knowing?"
5|77|say, "O peopl of the scripture, do not exceed limit in your religion beyond the truth and do not follow the inclin of a peopl who had gone astray befor and misl mani and have stray from the sound of the way."
5|78|curs were those who disbeliev among the children of israel by the tongu of david and of jesus, the son of mary. that wa becaus they disobey and [habitually] transgressed.
5|79|they use not to prevent one anoth from wrongdo that they did. how wretch wa that which they were doing.
5|80|you see mani of them becom alli of those who disbelieved. how wretch is that which they have put forth for themselv in that allah ha becom angri with them, and in the punish they will abid eternally.
5|81|and if they had believ in allah and the prophet and in what wa reveal to him, they would not have taken them as allies; but mani of them are defiantli disobedient.
5|82|y will sure find the most intens of the peopl in animos toward the believ [to be] the jew and those who associ other with allah; and you will find the nearest of them in affect to the believ those who say, "we are christians." that is becaus among them are priest and monk and becaus they are not arrogant.
5|83|and when they hear what ha been reveal to the messenger, you see their eye overflow with tear becaus of what they have recogn of the truth. they say, "our lord, we have believed, so regist us among the witnesses.
5|84|and whi should we not believ in allah and what ha come to us of the truth? and we aspir that our lord will admit us [to paradise] with the righteou people."
5|85|so allah reward them for what they said with garden [in paradise] beneath which river flow, wherein they abid eternally. and that is the reward of doer of good.
5|86|but those who disbeliev and deni our sign - they are the companion of hellfire.
5|87|o you who have believed, do not prohibit the good thing which allah ha made law to you and do not transgress. indeed, allah doe not like transgressors.
5|88|and eat of what allah ha provid for you [which is] law and good. and fear allah, in whom you are believers.
5|89|allah will not impos blame upon you for what is meaningless in your oaths, but He will impos blame upon you for [breaking] what you intend of oaths. So it expiat is the feed of ten needi peopl from the averag of that which you feed your [own] famili or cloth them or the free of a slave. but whoever cannot find [or afford it] - then a fast of three day [i required]. that is the expiat for oath when you have sworn. but guard your oaths. thu doe allah make clear to you hi vers that you may be grateful.
5|90|o you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrif on] stone alter [to other than allah], and divin arrow are but defil from the work of satan, so avoid it that you may be successful.
5|91|satan onli want to caus between you animos and hatr through intoxic and gambl and to avert you from the remembr of allah and from prayer. So will you not desist?
5|92|and obey allah and obey the messeng and beware. and if you turn away - then know that upon our messeng is onli [the respons for] clear notification.
5|93|ther is not upon those who believ and do righteous [any] blame concern what they have eaten [in the past] if they [now] fear allah and believ and do righteou deeds, and then fear allah and believe, and then fear allah and do good; and allah love the doer of good.
5|94|o you who have believed, allah will sure test you through someth of the game that your hand and spear [can] reach, that allah may make evid those who fear him unseen. and whoever transgress after that - for him is a pain punishment.
5|95|o you who have believed, do not kill game while you are in the state of ihram. and whoever of you kill it intent - the penalti is an equival from sacrifici anim to what he killed, as judg by two just men among you as an offer [to allah] deliv to the ka'bah, or an expiation: the feed of needi peopl or the equival of that in fasting, that he may tast the consequ of hi deed. allah ha pardon what is past; but whoever return [to violation], then allah will take retribut from him. and allah is exalt in might and owner of retribution.
5|96|law to you is game from the sea and it food as provis for you and the travelers, but forbidden to you is game from the land as long as you are in the state of ihram. and fear allah to whom you will be gathered.
5|97|allah ha made the ka'bah, the sacr house, stand for the peopl and [ha sanctified] the sacr month and the sacrifici anim and the garland [bi which they are identified]. that is so you may know that allah know what is in the heaven and what is in the earth and that allah is know of all things.
5|98|know that allah is sever in penalti and that allah is forgiv and merciful.
5|99|not upon the messeng is [responsibility] except [for] notification. and allah know whatev you reveal and whatev you conceal.
5|100|say, "not equal are the evil and the good, although the abund of evil might impress you." So fear allah, O you of understanding, that you may be successful.
5|101|o you who have believed, do not ask about thing which, if they are shown to you, will distress you. but if you ask about them while the qur'an is be revealed, they will be shown to you. allah ha pardon that which is past; and allah is forgiv and forbearing.
5|102|a peopl ask such [questions] befor you; then they becam therebi disbelievers.
5|103|allah ha not appoint [such innov as] bahirah or sa'ibah or wasilah or ham. but those who disbeliev invent falsehood about allah, and most of them do not reason.
5|104|and when it is said to them, "come to what allah ha reveal and to the messenger," they say, "suffici for us is that upon which we found our fathers." even though their father knew nothing, nor were they guided?
5|105|o you who have believed, upon you is [respons for] yourselves. those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guided. To allah is you return all together; then He will inform you of what you use to do.
5|106|o you who have believed, testimoni [should be taken] among you when death approach one of you at the time of bequest - [that of] two just men from among you or two other from outsid if you are travel through the land and the disast of death should strike you. detain them after the prayer and let them both swear by allah if you doubt [their testimony, saying], "we will not exchang our oath for a price, even if he should be a near relative, and we will not withhold the testimoni of allah. indeed, we would then be of the sinful."
5|107|but if it is found that those two were guilti of perjury, let two other stand in their place [who are] foremost [in claim] from those who have a law right. and let them swear by allah, "our testimoni is truer than their testimony, and we have not transgressed. indeed, we would then be of the wrongdoers."
5|108|that is more like that they will give testimoni accord to it [true] objective, or [at least] they would fear that [other] oath might be taken after their oaths. and fear allah and listen; and allah doe not guid the defiantli disobedi people.
5|109|[b warn of] the day when allah will assembl the messeng and say, "what wa the respons you received?" they will say, "we have no knowledge. indeed, it is you who is knower of the unseen"
5|110|[th day] when allah will say, "O jesus, son of mary, rememb My favor upon you and upon your mother when I support you with the pure spirit and you spoke to the peopl in the cradl and in maturity; and [remember] when I taught you write and wisdom and the torah and the gospel; and when you design from clay [what was] like the form of a bird with My permission, then you breath into it, and it becam a bird with My permission; and you heal the blind and the leper with My permission; and when you brought forth the dead with My permission; and when I restrain the children of israel from [killing] you when you came to them with clear proof and those who disbeliev among them said, "thi is not but obviou magic."
5|111|and [remember] when I inspir to the disciples, "believ in Me and in My messeng jesus." they said, "we have believed, so bear wit that inde we are muslim [in submiss to allah]."
5|112|[and remember] when the discipl said, "O jesus, son of mary, can your lord send down to us a tabl [spread with food] from the heaven? [jesus] said," fear allah, if you should be believers."
5|113|they said, "we wish to eat from it and let our heart be reassur and know that you have been truth to us and be among it witnesses."
5|114|said jesus, the son of mary, "O allah, our lord, send down to us a tabl [spread with food] from the heaven to be for us a festiv for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from you. and provid for us, and you are the best of providers."
5|115|allah said, "indeed, I will sent it down to you, but whoever disbeliev afterward from among you - then inde will I punish him with a punish by which I have not punish anyon among the worlds."
5|116|and [bewar the day] when allah will say, "O jesus, son of mary, did you say to the people, 'take me and my mother as deiti besid allah?'" He will say, "exalt are you! It wa not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, you would have known it. you know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within yourself. indeed, it is you who is knower of the unseen.
5|117|i said not to them except what you command me - to worship allah, my lord and your lord. and I wa a wit over them as long as I wa among them; but when you took me up, you were the observ over them, and you are, over all things, witness.
5|118|if you should punish them - inde they are your servants; but if you forgiv them - inde it is you who is the exalt in might, the wise.
5|119|allah will say, "thi is the day when the truth will benefit from their truthfulness." for them are garden [in paradise] beneath which river flow, wherein they will abid forever, allah be pleas with them, and they with him. that is the great attainment.
5|120|to allah belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth and whatev is within them. and He is over all thing competent.
6|1|[all] prais is [due] to allah, who creat the heaven and the earth and made the dark and the light. then those who disbeliev equat [others] with their lord.
6|2|it is He who creat you from clay and then decre a term and a specifi time [known] to him; then [still] you are in dispute.
6|3|and He is allah, [the onli deity] in the heaven and the earth. He know your secret and what you make public, and He know that which you earn.
6|4|and no sign come to them from the sign of their lord except that they turn away therefrom.
6|5|for they had deni the truth when it came to them, but there is go to reach them the news of what they use to ridicule.
6|6|hav they not seen how mani gener We destroy befor them which We had establish upon the earth as We have not establish you? and We sent [rain from] the sky upon them in shower and made river flow beneath them; then We destroy them for their sin and brought forth after them a gener of others.
6|7|and even if We had sent down to you, [O muhammad], a written scriptur on a page and they touch it with their hands, the disbeliev would say, "thi is not but obviou magic."
6|8|and they say, "whi wa there not sent down to him an angel?" but if We had sent down an angel, the matter would have been decided; then they would not be reprieved.
6|9|and if We had made him an angel, We would have made him [appear as] a man, and We would have cover them with that in which they cover themselves.
6|10|and alreadi were messeng ridicul befor you, but those who mock them were envelop by that which they use to ridicule.
6|11|say, "travel through the land; then observ how wa the end of the deniers."
6|12|say, "to whom belong whatev is in the heaven and earth?" say, "to allah." He ha decre upon himself mercy. He will sure assembl you for the day of resurrection, about which there is no doubt. those who will lose themselv [that day] do not believe.
6|13|and to him belong that which repos by night and by day, and He is the hearing, the knowing.
6|14|say, "i it other than allah I should take as a protector, creator of the heaven and the earth, while it is He who feed and is not fed?" say, [O muhammad], "indeed, I have been command to be the first [among you] who submit [to allah] and [wa commanded], 'do not ever be of the polytheists.' "
6|15|say, "inde I fear, if I should disobey my lord, the punish of a tremend day."
6|16|h from whom it is avert that day - [allah] ha grant him mercy. and that is the clear attainment.
6|17|and if allah should touch you with adversity, there is no remov of it except him. and if He touch you with good - then He is over all thing competent.
6|18|and He is the subjug over hi servants. and He is the wise, the acquaint [with all].
6|19|say, "what thing is greatest in testimony?" say, "allah is wit between me and you. and thi qur'an wa reveal to me that I may warn you therebi and whomev it reaches. Do you [truly] testifi that with allah there are other deities?" say, "I will not testifi [with you]." say, "indeed, He is but one god, and indeed, I am free of what you associ [with him]."
6|20|thos to whom We have given the scriptur recogn it as they recogn their [own] sons. those who will lose themselv [in the hereafter] do not believe.
6|21|and who is more unjust than one who invent about allah a lie or deni hi verses? indeed, the wrongdoer will not succeed.
6|22|and [mention, O muhammad], the day We will gather them all together; then We will say to those who associ other with allah, "where are your 'partners' that you use to claim [with him]?"
6|23|then there will be no [excus upon] examin except they will say, "bi allah, our lord, we were not those who associated."
6|24|se how they will lie about themselves. and lost from them will be what they use to invent.
6|25|and among them are those who listen to you, but We have place over their heart coverings, lest they understand it, and in their ear deafness. and if they should see everi sign, they will not believ in it. even when they come to you argu with you, those who disbeliev say, "thi is not but legend of the former peoples."
6|26|and they prevent [others] from him and are [themselves] remot from him. and they do not destroy except themselves, but they perceiv [it] not.
6|27|if you could but see when they are made to stand befor the fire and will say, "oh, would that we could be return [to life on earth] and not deni the sign of our lord and be among the believers."
6|28|but what they conceal befor ha [now] appear to them. and even if they were returned, they would return to that which they were forbidden; and indeed, they are liars.
6|29|and they say, "there is none but our worldli life, and we will not be resurrected."
6|30|if you could but see when they will be made to stand befor their lord. He will say, "i thi not the truth?" they will say, "yes, by our lord." He will [then] say, "so tast the punish becaus you use to disbelieve."
6|31|thos will have lost who deni the meet with allah, until when the hour [of resurrection] come upon them unexpectedly, they will say, "oh, [how great is] our regret over what we neglect concern it," while they bear their burden on their backs. unquestionably, evil is that which they bear.
6|32|and the worldli life is not but amus and diversion; but the home of the hereaft is best for those who fear allah, so will you not reason?
6|33|w know that you, [O muhammad], are sadden by what they say. and indeed, they do not call you untruthful, but it is the vers of allah that the wrongdoer reject.
6|34|and certainli were messeng deni befor you, but they were patient over [the effect of] denial, and they were harm until our victori came to them. and none can alter the word of allah. and there ha certainli come to you some inform about the [previous] messengers.
6|35|and if their evas is difficult for you, then if you are abl to seek a tunnel into the earth or a stairway into the sky to bring them a sign, [then do so]. but if allah had willed, He would have unit them upon guidance. So never be of the ignorant.
6|36|onli those who hear will respond. but the dead - allah will resurrect them; then to him they will be returned.
6|37|and they say, "whi ha a sign not been sent down to him from hi lord?" say, "indeed, allah is abl to send down a sign, but most of them do not know."
6|38|and there is no creatur on [or within] the earth or bird that fli with it wing except [that they are] commun like you. We have not neglect in the regist a thing. then unto their lord they will be gathered.
6|39|but those who deni our vers are deaf and dumb within darknesses. whomev allah will - He leav astray; and whomev He will - He put him on a straight path.
6|40|say, "have you considered: if there came to you the punish of allah or there came to you the hour - is it other than allah you would invoke, if you should be truthful?"
6|41|no, it is him [alone] you would invoke, and He would remov that for which you invok him if He willed, and you would forget what you associ [with him].
6|42|and We have alreadi sent [messengers] to nation befor you, [O muhammad]; then We seiz them with poverti and hardship that perhap they might humbl themselv [to us].
6|43|then why, when our punish came to them, did they not humbl themselves? but their heart becam hardened, and satan made attract to them that which they were doing.
6|44|so when they forgot that by which they had been reminded, We open to them the door of everi [good] thing until, when they rejoic in that which they were given, We seiz them suddenly, and they were [then] in despair.
6|45|so the peopl that commit wrong were eliminated. and prais to allah, lord of the worlds.
6|46|say, "have you considered: if allah should take away your hear and your sight and set a seal upon your hearts, which deiti other than allah could bring them [back] to you?" look how we diversifi the verses; then they [still] turn away.
6|47|say, "have you considered: if the punish of allah should come to you unexpectedli or manifestly, will ani be destroy but the wrongdo people?"
6|48|and We send not the messeng except as bringer of good tide and warners. So whoever believ and reform - there will be no fear concern them, nor will they grieve.
6|49|but those who deni our vers - the punish will touch them for their defiant disobedience.
6|50|say, [O muhammad], "I do not tell you that I have the depositori [contain the provision] of allah or that I know the unseen, nor do I tell you that I am an angel. I onli follow what is reveal to me." say, "i the blind equival to the seeing? then will you not give thought?"
6|51|and warn by the qur'an those who fear that they will be gather befor their lord - for them besid him will be no protector and no intercessor - that they might becom righteous.
6|52|and do not send away those who call upon their lord morn and afternoon, seek hi countenance. not upon you is anyth of their account and not upon them is anyth of your account. So were you to send them away, you would [then] be of the wrongdoers.
6|53|and thu We have tri some of them through other that the disbeliev might say, "i it these whom allah ha favor among us?" Is not allah most know of those who are grateful?
6|54|and when those come to you who believ in our verses, say, "peac be upon you. your lord ha decre upon himself mercy: that ani of you who doe wrong out of ignor and then repent after that and correct himself - indeed, He is forgiv and merciful."
6|55|and thu do We detail the verses, and [thus] the way of the crimin will becom evident.
6|56|say, "indeed, I have been forbidden to worship those you invok besid allah." say, "I will not follow your desires, for I would then have gone astray, and I would not be of the [rightly] guided."
6|57|say, "indeed, I am on clear evid from my lord, and you have deni it. I do not have that for which you are impatient. the decis is onli for allah. He relat the truth, and He is the best of deciders."
6|58|say, "if I had that for which you are impatient, the matter would have been decid between me and you, but allah is most know of the wrongdoers."
6|59|and with him are the key of the unseen; none know them except him. and He know what is on the land and in the sea. not a leaf fall but that He know it. and no grain is there within the dark of the earth and no moist or dri [thing] but that it is [written] in a clear record.
6|60|and it is He who take your soul by night and know what you have commit by day. then He reviv you therein that a specifi term may be fulfilled. then to him will be your return; then He will inform you about what you use to do.
6|61|and He is the subjug over hi servants, and He send over you guardian-angel until, when death come to one of you, our messeng take him, and they do not fail [in their duties].
6|62|then they hi servant are return to allah, their true lord. unquestionably, hi is the judgement, and He is the swiftest of accountants.
6|63|say, "who rescu you from the dark of the land and sea [when] you call upon him implor [aloud] and privately, 'if He should save us from thi [crisis], we will sure be among the thankful.' "
6|64|say, "it is allah who save you from it and from everi distress; then you [still] associ other with him."
6|65|say, "he is the [one] abl to send upon you afflict from abov you or from beneath your feet or to confus you [so you become] sect and make you tast the violenc of one another." look how We diversifi the sign that they might understand.
6|66|but your peopl have deni it while it is the truth. say, "I am not over you a manager."
6|67|for everi happen is a finality; and you are go to know.
6|68|and when you see those who engag in [offensive] discours concern our verses, then turn away from them until they enter into anoth conversation. and if satan should caus you to forget, then do not remain after the remind with the wrongdo people.
6|69|and those who fear allah are not held account for the disbeliev at all, but [onli for] a remind - that perhap they will fear him.
6|70|and leav those who take their religion as amus and divers and whom the worldli life ha deluded. but remind with the qur'an, lest a soul be given up to destruct for what it earned; it will have other than allah no protector and no intercessor. and if it should offer everi compensation, it would not be taken from it. those are the one who are given to destruct for what they have earned. for them will be a drink of scald water and a pain punish becaus they use to disbelieve.
6|71|say, "shall we invok instead of allah that which neither benefit us nor harm us and be turn back on our heel after allah ha guid us? [we would then be] like one whom the devil entic [to wander] upon the earth confused, [while] he ha companion invit him to guidance, [calling], 'come to us.' " say, "indeed, the guidanc of allah is the [only] guidance; and we have been command to submit to the lord of the worlds.
6|72|and to establish prayer and fear him." and it is He to whom you will be gathered.
6|73|and it is He who creat the heaven and earth in truth. and the day He says, "be," and it is, hi word is the truth. and hi is the dominion [on] the day the horn is blown. [he is] knower of the unseen and the witnessed; and He is the wise, the acquainted.
6|74|and [mention, O muhammad], when abraham said to hi father azar, "do you take idol as deities? indeed, I see you and your peopl to be in manifest error."
6|75|and thu did We show abraham the realm of the heaven and the earth that he would be among the certain [in faith]
6|76|so when the night cover him [with darkness], he saw a star. He said, "thi is my lord." but when it set, he said, "I like not those that disappear."
6|77|and when he saw the moon rising, he said, "thi is my lord." but when it set, he said, "unless my lord guid me, I will sure be among the peopl gone astray."
6|78|and when he saw the sun rising, he said, "thi is my lord; thi is greater." but when it set, he said, "O my people, inde I am free from what you associ with allah.
6|79|indeed, I have turn my face toward He who creat the heaven and the earth, inclin toward truth, and I am not of those who associ other with allah."
6|80|and hi peopl argu with him. He said, "do you argu with me concern allah while He ha guid me? and I fear not what you associ with him [and will not be harmed] unless my lord should will something. My lord encompass all thing in knowledge; then will you not remember?
6|81|and how should I fear what you associ while you do not fear that you have associ with allah that for which He ha not sent down to you ani authority? So which of the two parti ha more right to security, if you should know?
6|82|they who believ and do not mix their belief with injustic - those will have security, and they are [rightly] guided.
6|83|and that wa our [conclusive] argument which We gave abraham against hi people. We rais by degre whom We will. indeed, your lord is wise and knowing.
6|84|and We gave to abraham, isaac and jacob - all [of them] We guided. and noah, We guid before; and among hi descendants, david and solomon and job and joseph and mose and aaron. thu do We reward the doer of good.
6|85|and zechariah and john and jesu and elia - and all were of the righteous.
6|86|and ishmael and elisha and jonah and lot - and all [of them] We prefer over the worlds.
6|87|and [some] among their father and their descend and their brother - and We chose them and We guid them to a straight path.
6|88|that is the guidanc of allah by which He guid whomev He will of hi servants. but if they had associ other with allah, then worthless for them would be whatev they were doing.
6|89|thos are the one to whom We gave the scriptur and author and prophethood. but if the disbeliev deni it, then We have entrust it to a peopl who are not therein disbelievers.
6|90|thos are the one whom allah ha guided, so from their guidanc take an example. say, "I ask of you for thi messag no payment. It is not but a remind for the worlds."
6|91|and they did not apprais allah with true apprais when they said, "allah did not reveal to a human be anything." say, "who reveal the scriptur that mose brought as light and guidanc to the people? you [jews] make it into pages, disclos [some of] it and conceal much. and you were taught that which you knew not - neither you nor your fathers." say, "allah [reveal it]." then leav them in their [empty] discourse, amus themselves.
6|92|and thi is a book which We have sent down, bless and confirm what wa befor it, that you may warn the mother of citi and those around it. those who believ in the hereaft believ in it, and they are maintain their prayers.
6|93|and who is more unjust than one who invent a lie about allah or says, "it ha been inspir to me," while noth ha been inspir to him, and one who says, "I will reveal [something] like what allah revealed." and if you could but see when the wrongdoer are in the overwhelm pang of death while the angel extend their hands, [saying], "discharg your souls! today you will be award the punish of [extreme] humili for what you use to say against allah other than the truth and [that] you were, toward hi verses, be arrogant."
6|94|[it will be said to them], "and you have certainli come to Us alon as We creat you the first time, and you have left whatev We bestow upon you behind you. and We do not see with you your 'intercessors' which you claim that they were among you associ [of allah]. It ha [all] been sever between you, and lost from you is what you use to claim."
6|95|indeed, allah is the cleaver of grain and date seeds. He bring the live out of the dead and bring the dead out of the living. that is allah; so how are you deluded?
6|96|[h is] the cleaver of daybreak and ha made the night for rest and the sun and moon for calculation. that is the determin of the exalt in might, the knowing.
6|97|and it is He who place for you the star that you may be guid by them through the dark of the land and sea. We have detail the sign for a peopl who know.
6|98|and it is He who produc you from one soul and [gave you] a place of dwell and of storage. We have detail the sign for a peopl who understand.
6|99|and it is He who send down rain from the sky, and We produc therebi the growth of all things. We produc from it greeneri from which We produc grain arrang in layers. and from the palm tree - of it emerg fruit are cluster hang low. and [we produce] garden of grapevin and oliv and pomegranates, similar yet varied. look at [each of] it fruit when it yield and [at] it ripening. inde in that are sign for a peopl who believe.
6|100|but they have attribut to allah partner - the jinn, while He ha creat them - and have fabric for him son and daughters. exalt is He and high abov what they describe
6|101|[h is] origin of the heaven and the earth. how could He have a son when He doe not have a companion and He creat all things? and He is, of all things, knowing.
6|102|that is allah, your lord; there is no deiti except him, the creator of all things, so worship him. and He is dispos of all things.
6|103|vis perceiv him not, but He perceiv [all] vision; and He is the subtle, the acquainted.
6|104|ther ha come to you enlighten from your lord. So whoever will see doe so for [the benefit of] hi soul, and whoever is blind [doe harm] against it. and [say], "I am not a guardian over you."
6|105|and thu do We diversifi the vers so the disbeliev will say, "you have studied," and so We may make the qur'an clear for a peopl who know.
6|106|follow, [O muhammad], what ha been reveal to you from your lord - there is no deiti except him - and turn away from those who associ other with allah.
6|107|but if allah had willed, they would not have associated. and We have not appoint you over them as a guardian, nor are you a manag over them.
6|108|and do not insult those they invok other than allah, lest they insult allah in enmiti without knowledge. thu We have made pleas to everi commun their deeds. then to their lord is their return, and He will inform them about what they use to do.
6|109|and they swear by allah their strongest oath that if a sign came to them, they would sure believ in it. say, "the sign are onli with allah." and what will make you perceiv that even if a sign came, they would not believe.
6|110|and We will turn away their heart and their eye just as they refus to believ in it the first time. and We will leav them in their transgression, wander blindly.
6|111|and even if We had sent down to them the angel [with the message] and the dead spoke to them [of it] and We gather togeth everi [created] thing in front of them, they would not believ unless allah should will. but most of them, [of that], are ignorant.
6|112|and thu We have made for everi prophet an enemi - devil from mankind and jinn, inspir to one anoth decor speech in delusion. but if your lord had willed, they would not have done it, so leav them and that which they invent.
6|113|and [it is] so the heart of those who disbeliev in the hereaft will inclin toward it and that they will be satisfi with it and that they will commit that which they are committing.
6|114|[say], "then is it other than allah I should seek as judg while it is He who ha reveal to you the book explain in detail?" and those to whom We [previously] gave the scriptur know that it is sent down from your lord in truth, so never be among the doubters.
6|115|and the word of your lord ha been fulfil in truth and in justice. none can alter hi words, and He is the hearing, the knowing.
6|116|and if you obey most of those upon the earth, they will mislead you from the way of allah. they follow not except assumption, and they are not but falsifying.
6|117|indeed, your lord is most know of who stray from hi way, and He is most know of the [rightly] guided.
6|118|so eat of that [meat] upon which the name of allah ha been mentioned, if you are believ in hi verses.
6|119|and whi should you not eat of that upon which the name of allah ha been mention while He ha explain in detail to you what He ha forbidden you, except that to which you are compelled. and inde do mani lead [others] astray through their [own] inclin without knowledge. indeed, your lord - He is most know of the transgressors.
6|120|and leav what is appar of sin and what is conceal thereof. indeed, those who earn [blame for] sin will be recompens for that which they use to commit.
6|121|and do not eat of that upon which the name of allah ha not been mentioned, for indeed, it is grave disobedience. and inde do the devil inspir their alli [among men] to disput with you. and if you were to obey them, indeed, you would be associ [of other with him].
6|122|and is one who wa dead and We gave him life and made for him light by which to walk among the peopl like one who is in darkness, never to emerg therefrom? thu it ha been made pleas to the disbeliev that which they were doing.
6|123|and thu We have place within everi citi the greatest of it crimin to conspir therein. but they conspir not except against themselves, and they perceiv [it] not.
6|124|and when a sign come to them, they say, "never will we believ until we are given like that which wa given to the messeng of allah." allah is most know of where He place hi message. there will afflict those who commit crime debas befor allah and sever punish for what they use to conspire.
6|125|so whoever allah want to guid - He expand hi breast to [contain] islam; and whoever He want to misguid - He make hi breast tight and constrict as though he were climb into the sky. thu doe allah place defil upon those who do not believe.
6|126|and thi is the path of your lord, [leading] straight. We have detail the vers for a peopl who remember.
6|127|for them will be the home of peac with their lord. and He will be their protect friend becaus of what they use to do.
6|128|and [mention, O muhammad], the day when He will gather them togeth [and say], "O compani of jinn, you have [misled] mani of mankind." and their alli among mankind will say, "our lord, some of us made use of others, and we have [now] reach our term, which you appoint for us." He will say, "the fire is your residence, wherein you will abid eternally, except for what allah wills. indeed, your lord is wise and knowing."
6|129|and thu will We make some of the wrongdoer alli of other for what they use to earn.
6|130|"o compani of jinn and mankind, did there not come to you messeng from among you, relat to you My vers and warn you of the meet of thi day of yours?" they will say, "we bear wit against ourselves"; and the worldli life had delud them, and they will bear wit against themselv that they were disbelievers.
6|131|that is becaus your lord would not destroy the citi for wrongdo while their peopl were unaware.
6|132|and for all are degre from what they have done. and your lord is not unawar of what they do.
6|133|and your lord is the free of need, the possessor of mercy. If He wills, he can do away with you and give success after you to whomev He wills, just as He produc you from the descend of anoth people.
6|134|indeed, what you are promis is coming, and you will not caus failur [to allah].
6|135|say, "O my people, work accord to your position; [for] indeed, I am working. and you are go to know who will have success in the home. indeed, the wrongdoer will not succeed.
6|136|and the polytheist assign to allah from that which He creat of crop and livestock a share and say, "thi is for allah," by their claim, "and thi is for our partner [associ with him]." but what is for their "partners" doe not reach allah, while what is for allah - thi reach their "partners." evil is that which they rule.
6|137|and likewise, to mani of the polytheist their partner have made [to seem] pleas the kill of their children in order to bring about their destruct and to cover them with confus in their religion. and if allah had willed, they would not have done so. So leav them and that which they invent.
6|138|and they say, "these anim and crop are forbidden; no one may eat from them except whom we will," by their claim. and there are those [camels] whose back are forbidden [bi them] and those upon which the name of allah is not mention - [all of this] an invent of untruth about him. He will punish them for what they were inventing.
6|139|and they say, "what is in the belli of these anim is exclus for our male and forbidden to our females. but if it is [born] dead, then all of them have share therein." He will punish them for their description. indeed, He is wise and knowing.
6|140|thos will have lost who kill their children in foolish without knowledg and prohibit what allah had provid for them, invent untruth about allah. they have gone astray and were not [rightly] guided.
6|141|and He it is who caus garden to grow, [both] trellis and untrellised, and palm tree and crop of differ [kind of] food and oliv and pomegranates, similar and dissimilar. eat of [each of] it fruit when it yield and give it due [zakah] on the day of it harvest. and be not excessive. indeed, He doe not like those who commit excess.
6|142|and of the graze livestock are carrier [of burdens] and those [too] small. eat of what allah ha provid for you and do not follow the footstep of satan. indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.
6|143|[they are] eight mate - of the sheep, two and of the goats, two. say, "i it the two male He ha forbidden or the two femal or that which the womb of the two femal contain? inform me with knowledge, if you should be truthful."
6|144|and of the camels, two and of the cattle, two. say, "i it the two male He ha forbidden or the two femal or that which the womb of the two femal contain? Or were you wit when allah charg you with this? then who is more unjust than one who invent a lie about allah to mislead the peopl by [something] other than knowledge? indeed, allah doe not guid the wrongdo people."
6|145|say, "I do not find within that which wa reveal to me [anything] forbidden to one who would eat it unless it be a dead anim or blood spill out or the flesh of swine - for indeed, it is impur - or it be [that slaughter in] disobedience, dedic to other than allah. but whoever is forc [bi necessity], neither desir [it] nor transgress [it limit], then indeed, your lord is forgiv and merciful."
6|146|and to those who are jew We prohibit everi anim of uncloven hoof; and of the cattl and the sheep We prohibit to them their fat, except what adher to their back or the entrail or what is join with bone. [by] that We repaid them for their injustice. and indeed, We are truthful.
6|147|so if they deni you, [O muhammad], say, "your lord is the possessor of vast mercy; but hi punish cannot be repel from the peopl who are criminals."
6|148|thos who associ with allah will say, "if allah had willed, we would not have associ [anything] and neither would our fathers, nor would we have prohibit anything." likewis did those befor deni until they tast our punishment. say, "do you have ani knowledg that you can produc for us? you follow not except assumption, and you are not but falsifying."
6|149|say, "with allah is the far-reach argument. If He had willed, He would have guid you all."
6|150|say, [O muhammad], "bring forward your wit who will testifi that allah ha prohibit this." and if they testify, do not testifi with them. and do not follow the desir of those who deni our vers and those who do not believ in the hereafter, while they equat [others] with their lord.
6|151|say, "come, I will recit what your lord ha prohibit to you. [he commands] that you not associ anyth with him, and to parents, good treatment, and do not kill your children out of poverty; We will provid for you and them. and do not approach immor - what is appar of them and what is concealed. and do not kill the soul which allah ha forbidden [to be killed] except by [legal] right. thi ha He instruct you that you may use reason."
6|152|and do not approach the orphan' properti except in a way that is best until he reach maturity. and give full measur and weight in justice. We do not charg ani soul except [with that within] it capacity. and when you testify, be just, even if [it concerns] a near relative. and the coven of allah fulfill. thi ha He instruct you that you may remember.
6|153|and, [moreover], thi is My path, which is straight, so follow it; and do not follow [other] ways, for you will be separ from hi way. thi ha He instruct you that you may becom righteous.
6|154|then We gave mose the scripture, make complet [our favor] upon the one who did good and as a detail explan of all thing and as guidanc and merci that perhap in [the matter of] the meet with their lord they would believe.
6|155|and thi [qur'an] is a book We have reveal [which is] blessed, so follow it and fear allah that you may receiv mercy.
6|156|[w reveal it] lest you say, "the scriptur wa onli sent down to two group befor us, but we were of their studi unaware,"
6|157|or lest you say, "if onli the scriptur had been reveal to us, we would have been better guid than they." So there ha [now] come to you a clear evid from your lord and a guidanc and mercy. then who is more unjust than one who deni the vers of allah and turn away from them? We will recompens those who turn away from our vers with the worst of punish for their have turn away.
6|158|do they [then] wait for anyth except that the angel should come to them or your lord should come or that there come some of the sign of your lord? the day that some of the sign of your lord will come no soul will benefit from it faith as long as it had not believ befor or had earn through it faith some good. say, "wait. indeed, we [also] are waiting."
6|159|indeed, those who have divid their religion and becom sect - you, [O muhammad], are not [associated] with them in anything. their affair is onli [left] to allah; then He will inform them about what they use to do.
6|160|whoev come [on the day of judgement] with a good deed will have ten time the like thereof [to hi credit], and whoever come with an evil deed will not be recompens except the like thereof; and they will not be wronged.
6|161|say, "indeed, my lord ha guid me to a straight path - a correct religion - the way of abraham, inclin toward truth. and he wa not among those who associ other with allah."
6|162|say, "indeed, my prayer, my rite of sacrifice, my live and my die are for allah, lord of the worlds.
6|163|no partner ha he. and thi I have been commanded, and I am the first [among you] of the muslims."
6|164|say, "i it other than allah I should desir as a lord while He is the lord of all things? and everi soul earn not [blame] except against itself, and no bearer of burden will bear the burden of another. then to your lord is your return, and He will inform you concern that over which you use to differ."
6|165|and it is He who ha made you successor upon the earth and ha rais some of you abov other in degre [of rank] that He may tri you through what He ha given you. indeed, your lord is swift in penalty; but indeed, He is forgiv and merciful.
7|1|alif, lam, meem, sad.
7|2|[thi is] a book reveal to you, [O muhammad] - so let there not be in your breast distress therefrom - that you may warn therebi and as a remind to the believers.
7|3|follow, [O mankind], what ha been reveal to you from your lord and do not follow other than him ani allies. littl do you remember.
7|4|and how mani citi have We destroyed, and our punish came to them at night or while they were sleep at noon.
7|5|and their declar when our punish came to them wa onli that they said, "indeed, we were wrongdoers!"
7|6|then We will sure question those to whom [a message] wa sent, and We will sure question the messengers.
7|7|then We will sure relat [their deeds] to them with knowledge, and We were not [at all] absent.
7|8|and the weigh [of deeds] that day will be the truth. So those whose scale are heavi - it is they who will be the successful.
7|9|and those whose scale are light - they are the one who will lose themselv for what injustic they were do toward our verses.
7|10|and We have certainli establish you upon the earth and made for you therein way of livelihood. littl are you grateful.
7|11|and We have certainli creat you, [O mankind], and given you [human] form. then We said to the angels, "prostrat to adam"; so they prostrated, except for iblees. He wa not of those who prostrated.
7|12|[allah] said, "what prevent you from prostrat when I command you?" [satan] said, "I am better than him. you creat me from fire and creat him from clay."
7|13|[allah] said, "descend from paradise, for it is not for you to be arrog therein. So get out; indeed, you are of the debased.
7|14|[satan] said, "repriev me until the day they are resurrected."
7|15|[allah] said, "indeed, you are of those reprieved."
7|16|[satan] said, "becaus you have put me in error, I will sure sit in wait for them on your straight path.
7|17|then I will come to them from befor them and from behind them and on their right and on their left, and you will not find most of them grate [to you]."
7|18|[allah] said, "get out of paradise, reproach and expelled. whoever follow you among them - I will sure fill hell with you, all together."
7|19|and "O adam, dwell, you and your wife, in paradis and eat from wherev you will but do not approach thi tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers."
7|20|but satan whisper to them to make appar to them that which wa conceal from them of their privat parts. He said, "your lord did not forbid you thi tree except that you becom angel or becom of the immortal."
7|21|and he swore [bi allah] to them, "indeed, I am to you from among the sincer advisors."
7|22|so he made them fall, through deception. and when they tast of the tree, their privat part becam appar to them, and they began to fasten togeth over themselv from the leav of paradise. and their lord call to them, "did I not forbid you from that tree and tell you that satan is to you a clear enemy?"
7|23|they said, "our lord, we have wrong ourselves, and if you do not forgiv us and have merci upon us, we will sure be among the losers."
7|24|[allah] said, "descend, be to one anoth enemies. and for you on the earth is a place of settlement and enjoy for a time."
7|25|h said, "therein you will live, and therein you will die, and from it you will be brought forth."
7|26|o children of adam, We have bestow upon you cloth to conceal your privat part and as adornment. but the cloth of righteous - that is best. that is from the sign of allah that perhap they will remember.
7|27|o children of adam, let not satan tempt you as he remov your parent from paradise, strip them of their cloth to show them their privat parts. indeed, he see you, he and hi tribe, from where you do not see them. indeed, We have made the devil alli to those who do not believe.
7|28|and when they commit an immorality, they say, "we found our father do it, and allah ha order us to do it." say, "indeed, allah doe not order immorality. Do you say about allah that which you do not know?"
7|29|say, [O muhammad], "mi lord ha order justic and that you maintain yourselv [in worship of him] at everi place [or time] of prostration, and invok him, sincer to him in religion." just as He origin you, you will return [to life] -
7|30|a group [of you] He guided, and a group deserv [to be in] error. indeed, they had taken the devil as alli instead of allah while they thought that they were guided.
7|31|o children of adam, take your adorn at everi masjid, and eat and drink, but be not excessive. indeed, He like not those who commit excess.
7|32|say, "who ha forbidden the adorn of allah which He ha produc for hi servant and the good [lawful] thing of provision?" say, "they are for those who believ dure the worldli life [but] exclus for them on the day of resurrection." thu do We detail the vers for a peopl who know.
7|33|say, "mi lord ha onli forbidden immor - what is appar of them and what is conceal - and sin, and oppress without right, and that you associ with allah that for which He ha not sent down authority, and that you say about allah that which you do not know."
7|34|and for everi nation is a [specified] term. So when their time ha come, they will not remain behind an hour, nor will they preced [it].
7|35|o children of adam, if there come to you messeng from among you relat to you My verses, then whoever fear allah and reform - there will be no fear concern them, nor will they grieve.
7|36|but the one who deni our vers and are arrog toward them - those are the companion of the fire; they will abid therein eternally.
7|37|and who is more unjust than one who invent about allah a lie or deni hi verses? those will attain their portion of the decre until when our messeng come to them to take them in death, they will say, "where are those you use to invok besid allah?" they will say, "they have depart from us," and will bear wit against themselv that they were disbelievers.
7|38|[allah] will say, "enter among nation which had pass on befor you of jinn and mankind into the fire." everi time a nation enters, it will curs it sister until, when they have all overtaken one anoth therein, the last of them will say about the first of them "our lord, these had misl us, so give them a doubl punish of the fire. He will say, "for each is double, but you do not know."
7|39|and the first of them will say to the last of them, "then you had not ani favor over us, so tast the punish for what you use to earn."
7|40|indeed, those who deni our vers and are arrog toward them - the gate of heaven will not be open for them, nor will they enter paradis until a camel enter into the eye of a needle. and thu do We recompens the criminals.
7|41|they will have from hell a bed and over them cover [of fire]. and thu do We recompens the wrongdoers.
7|42|but those who believ and did righteou deed - We charg no soul except [within] it capacity. those are the companion of paradise; they will abid therein eternally.
7|43|and We will have remov whatev is within their breast of resentment, [while] flow beneath them are rivers. and they will say, "prais to allah, who ha guid us to this; and we would never have been guid if allah had not guid us. certainli the messeng of our lord had come with the truth." and they will be called, "thi is paradise, which you have been made to inherit for what you use to do."
7|44|and the companion of paradis will call out to the companion of the fire, "we have alreadi found what our lord promis us to be true. have you found what your lord promis to be true?" they will say, "yes." then an announc will announc among them, "the curs of allah shall be upon the wrongdoers."
7|45|who avert [people] from the way of allah and sought to make it [seem] deviant while they were, concern the hereafter, disbelievers.
7|46|and between them will be a partition, and on [its] elev are men who recogn all by their mark. and they call out to the companion of paradise, "peac be upon you." they have not [yet] enter it, but they long intensely.
7|47|and when their eye are turn toward the companion of the fire, they say, "our lord, do not place us with the wrongdo people."
7|48|and the companion of the elev will call to men [within hell] whom they recogn by their mark, saying, "of no avail to you wa your gather and [the fact] that you were arrogant."
7|49|[allah will say], "are these the one whom you [inhabit of hell] swore that allah would never offer them mercy? enter paradise, [O peopl of the elevations]. No fear will there be concern you, nor will you grieve."
7|50|and the companion of the fire will call to the companion of paradise, "pour upon us some water or from whatev allah ha provid you." they will say, "indeed, allah ha forbidden them both to the disbelievers."
7|51|who took their religion as distract and amus and whom the worldli life deluded." So today We will forget them just as they forgot the meet of thi day of their and for have reject our verses.
7|52|and We had certainli brought them a book which We detail by knowledg - as guidanc and merci to a peopl who believe.
7|53|do they await except it result? the day it result come those who had ignor it befor will say, "the messeng of our lord had come with the truth, so are there [now] ani intercessor to interced for us or could we be sent back to do other than we use to do?" they will have lost themselves, and lost from them is what they use to invent.
7|54|indeed, your lord is allah, who creat the heaven and earth in six day and then establish himself abov the throne. He cover the night with the day, [anoth night] chase it rapidly; and [he created] the sun, the moon, and the stars, subject by hi command. unquestionably, hi is the creation and the command; bless is allah, lord of the worlds.
7|55|cal upon your lord in humil and privately; indeed, He doe not like transgressors.
7|56|and caus not corrupt upon the earth after it reformation. and invok him in fear and aspiration. indeed, the merci of allah is near to the doer of good.
7|57|and it is He who send the wind as good tide befor hi merci until, when they have carri heavi rainclouds, We drive them to a dead land and We send down rain therein and bring forth therebi [some] of all the fruits. thu will We bring forth the dead; perhap you may be reminded.
7|58|and the good land - it veget emerg by permiss of it lord; but that which is bad - noth emerg except sparsely, with difficulty. thu do We diversifi the sign for a peopl who are grateful.
7|59|w had certainli sent noah to hi people, and he said, "O my people, worship allah; you have no deiti other than him. indeed, I fear for you the punish of a tremend day.
7|60|said the emin among hi people, "indeed, we see you in clear error."
7|61|[noah] said, "O my people, there is not error in me, but I am a messeng from the lord of the worlds."
7|62|i convey to you the messag of my lord and advis you; and I know from allah what you do not know.
7|63|then do you wonder that there ha come to you a remind from your lord through a man from among you, that he may warn you and that you may fear allah so you might receiv mercy."
7|64|but they deni him, so We save him and those who were with him in the ship. and We drown those who deni our signs. indeed, they were a blind people.
7|65|and to the 'aad [we sent] their brother hud. He said, "O my people, worship allah; you have no deiti other than him. then will you not fear him?"
7|66|said the emin one who disbeliev among hi people, "indeed, we see you in foolishness, and indeed, we think you are of the liars."
7|67|[hud] said, "O my people, there is not foolish in me, but I am a messeng from the lord of the worlds."
7|68|i convey to you the messag of my lord, and I am to you a trustworthi adviser.
7|69|then do you wonder that there ha come to you a remind from your lord through a man from among you, that he may warn you? and rememb when He made you successor after the peopl of noah and increas you in statur extensively. So rememb the favor of allah that you might succeed.
7|70|they said, "have you come to us that we should worship allah alon and leav what our father have worshipped? then bring us what you promis us, if you should be of the truthful."
7|71|[hud] said, "alreadi have defil and anger fallen upon you from your lord. Do you disput with me concern [mere] name you have name them, you and your fathers, for which allah ha not sent down ani authority? then wait; indeed, I am with you among those who wait."
7|72|so We save him and those with him by merci from us. and We elimin those who deni our signs, and they were not [at all] believers.
7|73|and to the thamud [we sent] their brother salih. He said, "O my people, worship allah; you have no deiti other than him. there ha come to you clear evid from your lord. thi is the she-camel of allah [sent] to you as a sign. So leav her to eat within allah 's land and do not touch her with harm, lest there seiz you a pain punishment.
7|74|and rememb when He made you successor after the 'aad and settl you in the land, [and] you take for yourselv palac from it plain and carv from the mountains, homes. then rememb the favor of allah and do not commit abus on the earth, spread corruption."
7|75|said the emin one who were arrog among hi peopl to those who were oppress - to those who believ among them, "do you [actually] know that salih is sent from hi lord?" they said, "inde we, in that with which he wa sent, are believers."
7|76|said those who were arrogant, "inde we, in that which you have believed, are disbelievers."
7|77|so they hamstrung the she-camel and were insol toward the command of their lord and said, "O salih, bring us what you promis us, if you should be of the messengers."
7|78|so the earthquak seiz them, and they becam within their home [corpses] fallen prone.
7|79|and he turn away from them and said, "O my people, I had certainli convey to you the messag of my lord and advis you, but you do not like advisors."
7|80|and [we had sent] lot when he said to hi people, "do you commit such immor as no one ha preced you with from among the worlds?
7|81|indeed, you approach men with desire, instead of women. rather, you are a transgress people."
7|82|but the answer of hi peopl wa onli that they said, "evict them from your city! indeed, they are men who keep themselv pure."
7|83|so We save him and hi family, except for hi wife; she wa of those who remain [with the evildoers].
7|84|and We rain upon them a rain [of stones]. then see how wa the end of the criminals.
7|85|and to [the peopl of] madyan [we sent] their brother shu'ayb. He said, "O my people, worship allah; you have no deiti other than him. there ha come to you clear evid from your lord. So fulfil the measur and weight and do not depriv peopl of their due and caus not corrupt upon the earth after it reformation. that is better for you, if you should be believers.
7|86|and do not sit on everi path, threaten and avert from the way of allah those who believ in him, seek to make it [seem] deviant. and rememb when you were few and He increas you. and see how wa the end of the corrupters.
7|87|and if there should be a group among you who ha believ in that with which I have been sent and a group that ha not believed, then be patient until allah judg between us. and He is the best of judges."
7|88|said the emin one who were arrog among hi people, "we will sure evict you, O shu'ayb, and those who have believ with you from our city, or you must return to our religion." He said, "even if we were unwilling?"
7|89|w would have invent against allah a lie if we return to your religion after allah had save us from it. and it is not for us to return to it except that allah, our lord, should will. our lord ha encompass all thing in knowledge. upon allah we have relied. our lord, decid between us and our peopl in truth, and you are the best of those who give decision."
7|90|said the emin one who disbeliev among hi people, "if you should follow shu'ayb, indeed, you would then be losers."
7|91|so the earthquak seiz them, and they becam within their home [corpses] fallen prone.
7|92|thos who deni shu'ayb - it wa as though they had never resid there. those who deni shu'ayb - it wa they who were the losers.
7|93|and he turn away from them and said, "O my people, I had certainli convey to you the messag of my lord and advis you, so how could I griev for a disbeliev people?"
7|94|and We sent to no citi a prophet [who wa denied] except that We seiz it peopl with poverti and hardship that they might humbl themselv [to allah].
7|95|then We exchang in place of the bad [condition], good, until they increas [and prospered] and said, "our father [also] were touch with hardship and ease." So We seiz them suddenli while they did not perceive.
7|96|and if onli the peopl of the citi had believ and fear allah, We would have open upon them bless from the heaven and the earth; but they deni [the messengers], so We seiz them for what they were earning."
7|97|then, did the peopl of the citi feel secur from our punish come to them at night while they were asleep?
7|98|or did the peopl of the citi feel secur from our punish come to them in the morn while they were at play?
7|99|then did they feel secur from the plan of allah? but no one feel secur from the plan of allah except the lose people.
7|100|ha it not becom clear to those who inherit the earth after it [previous] peopl that if We willed, We could afflict them for their sins? but We seal over their heart so they do not hear.
7|101|thos citi - We relat to you, [O muhammad], some of their news. and certainli did their messeng come to them with clear proofs, but they were not to believ in that which they had deni before. thu doe allah seal over the heart of the disbelievers.
7|102|and We did not find for most of them ani covenant; but indeed, We found most of them defiantli disobedient.
7|103|then We sent after them mose with our sign to pharaoh and hi establishment, but they were unjust toward them. So see how wa the end of the corrupters.
7|104|and mose said, "O pharaoh, I am a messeng from the lord of the worlds
7|105|[who is] oblig not to say about allah except the truth. I have come to you with clear evid from your lord, so send with me the children of israel."
7|106|[pharaoh] said, "if you have come with a sign, then bring it forth, if you should be of the truthful."
7|107|so mose threw hi staff, and suddenli it wa a serpent, manifest.
7|108|and he drew out hi hand; thereupon it wa white [with radiance] for the observers.
7|109|said the emin among the peopl of pharaoh, "indeed, thi is a learn magician
7|110|who want to expel you from your land [through magic], so what do you instruct?"
7|111|they said, "postpon [the matter of] him and hi brother and send among the citi gatherers
7|112|who will bring you everi learn magician."
7|113|and the magician came to pharaoh. they said, "inde for us is a reward if we are the predominant."
7|114|h said, "yes, and, [moreover], you will be among those made near [to me]."
7|115|they said, "O moses, either you throw [your staff], or we will be the one to throw [first]."
7|116|h said, "throw," and when they threw, they bewitch the eye of the peopl and struck terror into them, and they present a great [feat of] magic.
7|117|and We inspir to moses, "throw your staff," and at onc it devour what they were falsifying.
7|118|so the truth wa established, and abolish wa what they were doing.
7|119|and pharaoh and hi peopl were overcom right there and becam debased.
7|120|and the magician fell down in prostrat [to allah].
7|121|they said, "we have believ in the lord of the worlds,
7|122|th lord of mose and aaron."
7|123|said pharaoh, "you believ in him befor I gave you permission. indeed, thi is a conspiraci which you conspir in the citi to expel therefrom it people. but you are go to know.
7|124|i will sure cut off your hand and your feet on opposit sides; then I will sure crucifi you all."
7|125|they said, "indeed, to our lord we will return.
7|126|and you do not resent us except becaus we believ in the sign of our lord when they came to us. our lord, pour upon us patienc and let us die as muslim [in submiss to you]."
7|127|and the emin among the peopl of pharaoh said," will you leav mose and hi peopl to caus corrupt in the land and abandon you and your gods?" [pharaoh] said, "we will kill their son and keep their women alive; and indeed, we are subjug over them."
7|128|said mose to hi people, "seek help through allah and be patient. indeed, the earth belong to allah. He caus to inherit it whom He will of hi servants. and the [best] outcom is for the righteous."
7|129|they said, "we have been harm befor you came to us and after you have come to us." He said, "perhap your lord will destroy your enemi and grant you success in the land and see how you will do."
7|130|and We certainli seiz the peopl of pharaoh with year of famin and a defici in fruit that perhap they would be reminded.
7|131|but when good came to them, they said, "thi is our [bi right]." and if a bad [condition] struck them, they saw an evil omen in mose and those with him. unquestionably, their fortun is with allah, but most of them do not know.
7|132|and they said, "no matter what sign you bring us with which to bewitch us, we will not be believ in you."
7|133|so We sent upon them the flood and locust and lice and frog and blood as distinct signs, but they were arrog and were a crimin people.
7|134|and when the punish descend upon them, they said, "O moses, invok for us your lord by what He ha promis you. If you [can] remov the punish from us, we will sure believ you, and we will send with you the children of israel."
7|135|but when We remov the punish from them until a term which they were to reach, then at onc they broke their word.
7|136|so We took retribut from them, and We drown them in the sea becaus they deni our sign and were heedless of them.
7|137|and We caus the peopl who had been oppress to inherit the eastern region of the land and the western ones, which We had blessed. and the good word of your lord wa fulfil for the children of israel becaus of what they had patient endured. and We destroy [all] that pharaoh and hi peopl were produc and what they had been building.
7|138|and We took the children of israel across the sea; then they came upon a peopl intent in devot to [some] idol of theirs. they said, "O moses, make for us a god just as they have gods." He said, "indeed, you are a peopl behav ignorantly.
7|139|indeed, those [worshippers] - destroy is that in which they are [engaged], and worthless is whatev they were doing."
7|140|h said, "i it other than allah I should desir for you as a god while He ha prefer you over the worlds?"
7|141|and [recall, O children of israel], when We save you from the peopl of pharaoh, [who were] afflict you with the worst torment - kill your son and keep your women alive. and in that wa a great trial from your lord.
7|142|and We made an appoint with mose for thirti night and perfect them by [the addit of] ten; so the term of hi lord wa complet as forti nights. and mose said to hi brother aaron, "take my place among my people, do right [bi them], and do not follow the way of the corrupters."
7|143|and when mose arriv at our appoint time and hi lord spoke to him, he said, "mi lord, show me [yourself] that I may look at you." [allah] said, "you will not see me, but look at the mountain; if it should remain in place, then you will see me." but when hi lord appear to the mountain, He render it level, and mose fell unconscious. and when he awoke, he said, "exalt are you! I have repent to you, and I am the first of the believers."
7|144|[allah] said, "O moses, I have chosen you over the peopl with My messag and My word [to you]. So take what I have given you and be among the grateful."
7|145|and We wrote for him on the tablet [something] of all thing - instruct and explan for all things, [saying], "take them with determin and order your peopl to take the best of it. I will show you the home of the defiantli disobedient."
7|146|i will turn away from My sign those who are arrog upon the earth without right; and if they should see everi sign, they will not believ in it. and if they see the way of consciousness, they will not adopt it as a way; but if they see the way of error, they will adopt it as a way. that is becaus they have deni our sign and they were heedless of them.
7|147|thos who deni our sign and the meet of the hereaft - their deed have becom worthless. are they recompens except for what they use to do?
7|148|and the peopl of mose made, after [hi departure], from their ornament a calf - an imag have a low sound. did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guid them to a way? they took it [for worship], and they were wrongdoers.
7|149|and when regret overcam them and they saw that they had gone astray, they said, "if our lord doe not have merci upon us and forgiv us, we will sure be among the losers."
7|150|and when mose return to hi people, angri and grieved, he said, "how wretch is that by which you have replac me after [mi departure]. were you impati over the matter of your lord?" and he threw down the tablet and seiz hi brother by [the hair of] hi head, pull him toward him. [aaron] said, "O son of my mother, inde the peopl oppress me and were about to kill me, so let not the enemi rejoic over me and do not place me among the wrongdo people."
7|151|[moses] said, "mi lord, forgiv me and my brother and admit us into your mercy, for you are the most merci of the merciful."
7|152|indeed, those who took the calf [for worship] will obtain anger from their lord and humili in the life of thi world, and thu do We recompens the inventor [of falsehood].
7|153|but those who commit misde and then repent after them and believ - inde your lord, thereafter, is forgiv and merciful.
7|154|and when the anger subsid in moses, he took up the tablets; and in their inscript wa guidanc and merci for those who are fear of their lord.
7|155|and mose chose from hi peopl seventi men for our appointment. and when the earthquak seiz them, he said, "mi lord, if you had willed, you could have destroy them befor and me [a well]. would you destroy us for what the foolish among us have done? thi is not but your trial by which you send astray whom you will and guid whom you will. you are our protector, so forgiv us and have merci upon us; and you are the best of forgivers.
7|156|and decre for us in thi world [that which is] good and [also] in the hereafter; indeed, we have turn back to you." [allah] said, "mi punish - I afflict with it whom I will, but My merci encompass all things." So I will decre it [especially] for those who fear Me and give zakah and those who believ in our vers -
7|157|those who follow the messenger, the unlett prophet, whom they find written in what they have of the torah and the gospel, who enjoin upon them what is right and forbid them what is wrong and make law for them the good thing and prohibit for them the evil and reliev them of their burden and the shackl which were upon them. So they who have believ in him, honor him, support him and follow the light which wa sent down with him - it is those who will be the successful.
7|158|say, [O muhammad], "O mankind, inde I am the messeng of allah to you all, [from him] to whom belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth. there is no deiti except him; He give life and caus death." So believ in allah and hi messenger, the unlett prophet, who believ in allah and hi words, and follow him that you may be guided.
7|159|and among the peopl of mose is a commun which guid by truth and by it establish justice.
7|160|and We divid them into twelv descend tribe [a distinct] nations. and We inspir to mose when hi peopl implor him for water, "strike with your staff the stone," and there gush forth from it twelv springs. everi peopl knew it water place. and We shade them with cloud and sent down upon them manna and quails, [saying], "eat from the good thing with which We have provid you." and they wrong Us not, but they were [only] wrong themselves.
7|161|and [mention, O muhammad], when it wa said to them, "dwell in thi citi and eat from it wherev you will and say, 'reliev us of our burdens,' and enter the gate bow humbly; We will [then] forgiv you your sins. We will increas the doer of good [in good and reward]."
7|162|but those who wrong among them chang [the words] to a statement other than that which had been said to them. So We sent upon them a punish from the sky for the wrong that they were doing.
7|163|and ask them about the town that wa by the sea - when they transgress in [the matter of] the sabbath - when their fish came to them openli on their sabbath day, and the day they had no sabbath they did not come to them. thu did We give them trial becaus they were defiantli disobedient.
7|164|and when a commun among them said, "whi do you advis [or warn] a peopl whom allah is [about] to destroy or to punish with a sever punishment?" they [the advisors] said, "to be absolv befor your lord and perhap they may fear him."
7|165|and when they forgot that by which they had been reminded, We save those who had forbidden evil and seiz those who wronged, with a wretch punishment, becaus they were defiantli disobeying.
7|166|so when they were insol about that which they had been forbidden, We said to them, "be apes, despised."
7|167|and [mention] when your lord declar that He would sure [continu to] send upon them until the day of resurrect those who would afflict them with the worst torment. indeed, your lord is swift in penalty; but indeed, He is forgiv and merciful.
7|168|and We divid them throughout the earth into nations. Of them some were righteous, and of them some were otherwise. and We test them with good [times] and bad that perhap they would return [to obedience].
7|169|and there follow them successor who inherit the scriptur [while] take the commod of thi lower life and saying, "it will be forgiven for us." and if an offer like it come to them, they will [again] take it. wa not the coven of the scriptur taken from them that they would not say about allah except the truth, and they studi what wa in it? and the home of the hereaft is better for those who fear allah, so will you not use reason?
7|170|but those who hold fast to the book and establish prayer - indeed, We will not allow to be lost the reward of the reformers.
7|171|and [mention] when We rais the mountain abov them as if it wa a dark cloud and they were certain that it would fall upon them, [and allah said], "take what We have given you with determin and rememb what is in it that you might fear allah."
7|172|and [mention] when your lord took from the children of adam - from their loin - their descend and made them testifi of themselves, [say to them], "am I not your lord?" they said, "yes, we have testified." [this] - lest you should say on the day of resurrection, "indeed, we were of thi unaware."
7|173|or [lest] you say, "it wa onli that our father associ [other in worship] with allah before, and we were but descend after them. then would you destroy us for what the falsifi have done?"
7|174|and thu do We [explain in] detail the verses, and perhap they will return.
7|175|and recit to them, [O muhammad], the news of him to whom we gave [knowledg of] our signs, but he detach himself from them; so satan pursu him, and he becam of the deviators.
7|176|and if We had willed, we could have elev him thereby, but he adher [instead] to the earth and follow hi own desire. So hi exampl is like that of the dog: if you chase him, he pants, or if you leav him, he [still] pants. that is the exampl of the peopl who deni our signs. So relat the stori that perhap they will give thought.
7|177|how evil an exampl [i that of] the peopl who deni our sign and use to wrong themselves.
7|178|whoev allah guid - he is the [rightly] guided; and whoever He send astray - it is those who are the losers.
7|179|and We have certainli creat for hell mani of the jinn and mankind. they have heart with which they do not understand, they have eye with which they do not see, and they have ear with which they do not hear. those are like livestock; rather, they are more astray. It is they who are the heedless.
7|180|and to allah belong the best names, so invok him by them. and leav [the compani of] those who practic deviat concern hi names. they will be recompens for what they have been doing.
7|181|and among those We creat is a commun which guid by truth and therebi establish justice.
7|182|but those who deni our sign - We will progress lead them [to destruction] from where they do not know.
7|183|and I will give them time. indeed, my plan is firm.
7|184|then do they not give thought? there is in their companion [muhammad] no madness. He is not but a clear warner.
7|185|do they not look into the realm of the heaven and the earth and everyth that allah ha creat and [think] that perhap their appoint time ha come near? So in what statement hereaft will they believe?
7|186|whoev allah send astray - there is no guid for him. and He leav them in their transgression, wander blindly.
7|187|they ask you, [O muhammad], about the hour: when is it arrival? say, "it knowledg is onli with my lord. none will reveal it time except him. It lay heavili upon the heaven and the earth. It will not come upon you except unexpectedly." they ask you as if you are familiar with it. say, "it knowledg is onli with allah, but most of the peopl do not know."
7|188|say, "I hold not for myself [the power of] benefit or harm, except what allah ha willed. and if I knew the unseen, I could have acquir much wealth, and no harm would have touch me. I am not except a warner and a bringer of good tide to a peopl who believe."
7|189|it is He who creat you from one soul and creat from it it mate that he might dwell in secur with her. and when he cover her, she carri a light burden and continu therein. and when it becom heavy, they both invok allah, their lord, "if you should give us a good [child], we will sure be among the grateful."
7|190|but when He give them a good [child], they ascrib partner to him concern that which He ha given them. exalt is allah abov what they associ with him.
7|191|do they associ with him those who creat noth and they are [themselves] created?
7|192|and the fals deiti are unabl to [give] them help, nor can they help themselves.
7|193|and if you [believers] invit them to guidance, they will not follow you. It is all the same for you whether you invit them or you are silent.
7|194|indeed, those you [polytheists] call upon besid allah are servant like you. So call upon them and let them respond to you, if you should be truthful.
7|195|do they have feet by which they walk? Or do they have hand by which they strike? Or do they have eye by which they see? Or do they have ear by which they hear? say, [O muhammad], "call your 'partners' and then conspir against me and give me no respite.
7|196|indeed, my protector is allah, who ha sent down the book; and He is an alli to the righteous.
7|197|and those you call upon besid him are unabl to help you, nor can they help themselves."
7|198|and if you invit them to guidance, they do not hear; and you see them look at you while they do not see.
7|199|tak what is given freely, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the ignorant.
7|200|and if an evil suggest come to you from satan, then seek refug in allah. indeed, He is hear and knowing.
7|201|indeed, those who fear allah - when an impuls touch them from satan, they rememb [him] and at onc they have insight.
7|202|but their brother - the devil increas them in error; then they do not stop short.
7|203|and when you, [O muhammad], do not bring them a sign, they say, "whi have you not contriv it?" say, "I onli follow what is reveal to me from my lord. thi [qur'an] is enlighten from your lord and guidanc and merci for a peopl who believe."
7|204|so when the qur'an is recited, then listen to it and pay attent that you may receiv mercy.
7|205|and rememb your lord within yourself in humil and in fear without be appar in speech - in the morn and the evenings. and do not be among the heedless.
7|206|indeed, those who are near your lord are not prevent by arrog from hi worship, and they exalt him, and to him they prostrate.
8|1|they ask you, [O muhammad], about the bounti [of war]. say, "the [decis concerning] bounti is for allah and the messenger." So fear allah and amend that which is between you and obey allah and hi messenger, if you should be believers.
8|2|th believ are onli those who, when allah is mentioned, their heart becom fearful, and when hi vers are recit to them, it increas them in faith; and upon their lord they reli -
8|3|the one who establish prayer, and from what We have provid them, they spend.
8|4|thos are the believers, truly. for them are degre [of high position] with their lord and forgiv and nobl provision.
8|5|[it is] just as when your lord brought you out of your home [for the battl of badr] in truth, while indeed, a parti among the believ were unwilling,
8|6|argu with you concern the truth after it had becom clear, as if they were be driven toward death while they were look on.
8|7|[remember, O believers], when allah promis you one of the two group - that it would be your - and you wish that the unarm one would be yours. but allah intend to establish the truth by hi word and to elimin the disbelievers
8|8|that He should establish the truth and abolish falsehood, even if the crimin dislik it.
8|9|[remember] when you ask help of your lord, and He answer you, "indeed, I will reinforc you with a thousand from the angels, follow one another."
8|10|and allah made it not but good tide and so that your heart would be assur thereby. and victori is not but from allah. indeed, allah is exalt in might and wise.
8|11|[remember] when He overwhelm you with drowsi [giving] secur from him and sent down upon you from the sky, rain by which to purifi you and remov from you the evil [suggestions] of satan and to make steadfast your heart and plant firmli therebi your feet.
8|12|[remember] when your lord inspir to the angels, "I am with you, so strengthen those who have believed. I will cast terror into the heart of those who disbelieved, so strike [them] upon the neck and strike from them everi fingertip."
8|13|that is becaus they oppos allah and hi messenger. and whoever oppos allah and hi messeng - indeed, allah is sever in penalty.
8|14|"that [i yours], so tast it." and inde for the disbeliev is the punish of the fire.
8|15|o you who have believed, when you meet those who disbeliev advanc [for battle], do not turn to them your back [in flight].
8|16|and whoever turn hi back to them on such a day, unless swerv [a a strategy] for war or join [another] company, ha certainli return with anger [upon him] from allah, and hi refug is hell - and wretch is the destination.
8|17|and you did not kill them, but it wa allah who kill them. and you threw not, [O muhammad], when you threw, but it wa allah who threw that He might test the believ with a good test. indeed, allah is hear and knowing.
8|18|that [i so], and [also] that allah will weaken the plot of the disbelievers.
8|19|if you [disbelievers] seek the victori - the defeat ha come to you. and if you desist [from hostilities], it is best for you; but if you return [to war], We will return, and never will you be avail by your [large] compani at all, even if it should increase; and [that is] becaus allah is with the believers.
8|20|o you who have believed, obey allah and hi messeng and do not turn from him while you hear [hi order].
8|21|and do not be like those who say, "we have heard," while they do not hear.
8|22|indeed, the worst of live creatur in the sight of allah are the deaf and dumb who do not use reason.
8|23|had allah known ani good in them, He would have made them hear. and if He had made them hear, they would [still] have turn away, while they were refusing.
8|24|o you who have believed, respond to allah and to the messeng when he call you to that which give you life. and know that allah interven between a man and hi heart and that to him you will be gathered.
8|25|and fear a trial which will not strike those who have wrong among you exclusively, and know that allah is sever in penalty.
8|26|and rememb when you were few and oppress in the land, fear that peopl might abduct you, but He shelter you, support you with hi victory, and provid you with good thing - that you might be grateful.
8|27|o you who have believed, do not betray allah and the messeng or betray your trust while you know [the consequence].
8|28|and know that your properti and your children are but a trial and that allah ha with him a great reward.
8|29|o you who have believed, if you fear allah, He will grant you a criterion and will remov from you your misde and forgiv you. and allah is the possessor of great bounty.
8|30|and [remember, O muhammad], when those who disbeliev plot against you to restrain you or kill you or evict you [from makkah]. but they plan, and allah plans. and allah is the best of planners.
8|31|and when our vers are recit to them, they say, "we have heard. If we willed, we could say [something] like this. thi is not but legend of the former peoples."
8|32|and [remember] when they said, "O allah, if thi should be the truth from you, then rain down upon us stone from the sky or bring us a pain punishment."
8|33|but allah would not punish them while you, [O muhammad], are among them, and allah would not punish them while they seek forgiveness.
8|34|but whi should allah not punish them while they obstruct [people] from al-masjid al- haram and they were not [fit to be] it guardians? it [true] guardian are not but the righteous, but most of them do not know.
8|35|and their prayer at the hous wa not except whistl and handclapping. So tast the punish for what you disbelieved.
8|36|indeed, those who disbeliev spend their wealth to avert [people] from the way of allah. So they will spend it; then it will be for them a [sourc of] regret; then they will be overcome. and those who have disbeliev - unto hell they will be gathered.
8|37|[thi is] so that allah may distinguish the wick from the good and place the wick some of them upon other and heap them all togeth and put them into hell. It is those who are the losers.
8|38|say to those who have disbeliev [that] if they cease, what ha previous occur will be forgiven for them. but if they return [to hostility] - then the preced of the former [rebellious] peopl ha alreadi taken place.
8|39|and fight them until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for allah. and if they ceas - then indeed, allah is see of what they do.
8|40|but if they turn away - then know that allah is your protector. excel is the protector, and excel is the helper.
8|41|and know that anyth you obtain of war booti - then indeed, for allah is one fifth of it and for the messeng and for [his] near rel and the orphans, the needy, and the [stranded] traveler, if you have believ in allah and in that which We sent down to our servant on the day of criterion - the day when the two armi met. and allah, over all things, is competent.
8|42|[remember] when you were on the near side of the valley, and they were on the farther side, and the caravan wa lower [in position] than you. If you had made an appoint [to meet], you would have miss the appointment. but [it was] so that allah might accomplish a matter alreadi destin - that those who perish [through disbelief] would perish upon evid and those who live [in faith] would live upon evidence; and indeed, allah is hear and knowing.
8|43|[remember, O muhammad], when allah show them to you in your dream as few; and if He had shown them to you as many, you [believers] would have lost courag and would have disput in the matter [of whether to fight], but allah save [you from that]. indeed, He is know of that within the breasts.
8|44|and [remember] when He show them to you, when you met, as few in your eyes, and He made you [appear] as few in their eye so that allah might accomplish a matter alreadi destined. and to allah are [all] matter returned.
8|45|o you who have believed, when you encount a compani [from the enemi forces], stand firm and rememb allah much that you may be successful.
8|46|and obey allah and hi messenger, and do not disput and [thus] lose courag and [then] your strength would depart; and be patient. indeed, allah is with the patient.
8|47|and do not be like those who came forth from their home insol and to be seen by peopl and avert [them] from the way of allah. and allah is encompass of what they do.
8|48|and [remember] when satan made their deed pleas to them and said, "no one can overcom you today from among the people, and indeed, I am your protector." but when the two armi sight each other, he turn on hi heel and said, "indeed, I am disassoci from you. indeed, I see what you do not see; inde I fear allah. and allah is sever in penalty."
8|49|[remember] when the hypocrit and those in whose heart wa diseas said, "their religion ha delud those [muslims]." but whoever reli upon allah - then indeed, allah is exalt in might and wise.
8|50|and if you could but see when the angel take the soul of those who disbelieved... they are strike their face and their back and [saying], "tast the punish of the burn fire.
8|51|that is for what your hand have put forth [of evil] and becaus allah is not ever unjust to hi servants."
8|52|[their is] like the custom of the peopl of pharaoh and of those befor them. they disbeliev in the sign of allah, so allah seiz them for their sins. indeed, allah is power and sever in penalty.
8|53|that is becaus allah would not chang a favor which He had bestow upon a peopl until they chang what is within themselves. and indeed, allah is hear and knowing.
8|54|[their is] like the custom of the peopl of pharaoh and of those befor them. they deni the sign of their lord, so We destroy them for their sins, and We drown the peopl of pharaoh. and all [of them] were wrongdoers.
8|55|indeed, the worst of live creatur in the sight of allah are those who have disbelieved, and they will not [ever] believ -
8|56|the one with whom you made a treati but then they break their pledg everi time, and they do not fear allah.
8|57|so if you, [O muhammad], gain domin over them in war, dispers by [mean of] them those behind them that perhap they will be reminded.
8|58|if you [have reason to] fear from a peopl betrayal, throw [their treaty] back to them, [put you] on equal terms. indeed, allah doe not like traitors.
8|59|and let not those who disbeliev think they will escape. indeed, they will not caus failur [to allah].
8|60|and prepar against them whatev you are abl of power and of steed of war by which you may terrifi the enemi of allah and your enemi and other besid them whom you do not know [but] whom allah knows. and whatev you spend in the caus of allah will be fulli repaid to you, and you will not be wronged.
8|61|and if they inclin to peace, then inclin to it [also] and reli upon allah. indeed, it is He who is the hearing, the knowing.
8|62|but if they intend to deceiv you - then suffici for you is allah. It is He who support you with hi help and with the believers
8|63|and brought togeth their hearts. If you had spent all that is in the earth, you could not have brought their heart together; but allah brought them together. indeed, He is exalt in might and wise.
8|64|o prophet, suffici for you is allah and for whoever follow you of the believers.
8|65|o prophet, urg the believ to battle. If there are among you twenti [who are] steadfast, they will overcom two hundred. and if there are among you one hundr [who are] steadfast, they will overcom a thousand of those who have disbeliev becaus they are a peopl who do not understand.
8|66|now, allah ha lighten [the hardship] for you, and He know that among you is weakness. So if there are from you one hundr [who are] steadfast, they will overcom two hundred. and if there are among you a thousand, they will overcom two thousand by permiss of allah. and allah is with the steadfast.
8|67|it is not for a prophet to have captiv [of war] until he inflict a massacr [upon allah 's enemies] in the land. some muslim desir the commod of thi world, but allah desir [for you] the hereafter. and allah is exalt in might and wise.
8|68|if not for a decre from allah that preceded, you would have been touch for what you took by a great punishment.
8|69|so consum what you have taken of war booti [a being] law and good, and fear allah. indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
8|70|o prophet, say to whoever is in your hand of the captives, "if allah know [any] good in your hearts, He will give you [something] better than what wa taken from you, and He will forgiv you; and allah is forgiv and merciful."
8|71|but if they intend to betray you - then they have alreadi betray allah before, and He empow [you] over them. and allah is know and wise.
8|72|indeed, those who have believ and emigr and fought with their wealth and live in the caus of allah and those who gave shelter and aid - they are alli of one another. but those who believ and did not emigr - for you there is no guardianship of them until they emigrate. and if they seek help of you for the religion, then you must help, except against a peopl between yourselv and whom is a treaty. and allah is see of what you do.
8|73|and those who disbeliev are alli of one another. If you do not do so, there will be fitnah on earth and great corruption.
8|74|but those who have believ and emigr and fought in the caus of allah and those who gave shelter and aid - it is they who are the believers, truly. for them is forgiv and nobl provision.
8|75|and those who believ after [the initi emigration] and emigr and fought with you - they are of you. but those of [blood] relationship are more entitl [to inheritance] in the decre of allah. indeed, allah is know of all things.
9|1|[thi is a declar of] disassociation, from allah and hi messenger, to those with whom you had made a treati among the polytheists.
9|2|so travel freely, [O disbelievers], throughout the land [during] four month but know that you cannot caus failur to allah and that allah will disgrac the disbelievers.
9|3|and [it is] an announc from allah and hi messeng to the peopl on the day of the greater pilgrimag that allah is disassoci from the disbelievers, and [so is] hi messenger. So if you repent, that is best for you; but if you turn away - then know that you will not caus failur to allah. and give tide to those who disbeliev of a pain punishment.
9|4|except are those with whom you made a treati among the polytheist and then they have not been defici toward you in anyth or support anyon against you; so complet for them their treati until their term [ha ended]. indeed, allah love the righteou [who fear him].
9|5|and when the sacr month have passed, then kill the polytheist wherev you find them and captur them and besieg them and sit in wait for them at everi place of ambush. but if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them [go] on their way. indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
9|6|and if ani one of the polytheist seek your protection, then grant him protect so that he may hear the word of allah. then deliv him to hi place of safety. that is becaus they are a peopl who do not know.
9|7|how can there be for the polytheist a treati in the sight of allah and with hi messenger, except for those with whom you made a treati at al-masjid al-haram? So as long as they are upright toward you, be upright toward them. indeed, allah love the righteou [who fear him].
9|8|how [can there be a treaty] while, if they gain domin over you, they do not observ concern you ani pact of kinship or coven of protection? they satisfi you with their mouths, but their heart refus [compliance], and most of them are defiantli disobedient.
9|9|they have exchang the sign of allah for a small price and avert [people] from hi way. indeed, it wa evil that they were doing.
9|10|they do not observ toward a believ ani pact of kinship or coven of protection. and it is they who are the transgressors.
9|11|but if they repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, then they are your brother in religion; and We detail the vers for a peopl who know.
9|12|and if they break their oath after their treati and defam your religion, then fight the leader of disbelief, for indeed, there are no oath [sacred] to them; [fight them that] they might cease.
9|13|would you not fight a peopl who broke their oath and determin to expel the messenger, and they had begun [the attack upon] you the first time? Do you fear them? but allah ha more right that you should fear him, if you are [truly] believers.
9|14|fight them; allah will punish them by your hand and will disgrac them and give you victori over them and satisfi the breast of a believ people
9|15|and remov the furi in the believers' hearts. and allah turn in forgiv to whom He wills; and allah is know and wise.
9|16|do you think that you will be left [a you are] while allah ha not yet made evid those among you who strive [for hi cause] and do not take other than allah, hi messeng and the believ as intimates? and allah is acquaint with what you do.
9|17|it is not for the polytheist to maintain the mosqu of allah [while] wit against themselv with disbelief. [for] those, their deed have becom worthless, and in the fire they will abid eternally.
9|18|th mosqu of allah are onli to be maintain by those who believ in allah and the last day and establish prayer and give zakah and do not fear except allah, for it is expect that those will be of the [rightly] guided.
9|19|hav you made the provid of water for the pilgrim and the mainten of al-masjid al-haram equal to [the deed of] one who believ in allah and the last day and strive in the caus of allah? they are not equal in the sight of allah. and allah doe not guid the wrongdo people.
9|20|th one who have believed, emigr and striven in the caus of allah with their wealth and their live are greater in rank in the sight of allah. and it is those who are the attain [of success].
9|21|their lord give them good tide of merci from him and approv and of garden for them wherein is endur pleasure.
9|22|[they will be] abid therein forever. indeed, allah ha with him a great reward.
9|23|o you who have believed, do not take your father or your brother as alli if they have prefer disbelief over belief. and whoever doe so among you - then it is those who are the wrongdoers.
9|24|say, [O muhammad], "if your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth which you have obtained, commerc wherein you fear decline, and dwell with which you are pleas are more belov to you than allah and hi messeng and jihad in hi cause, then wait until allah execut hi command. and allah doe not guid the defiantli disobedi people."
9|25|allah ha alreadi given you victori in mani region and [even] on the day of hunayn, when your great number pleas you, but it did not avail you at all, and the earth wa confin for you with it vastness; then you turn back, fleeing.
9|26|then allah sent down hi tranquil upon hi messeng and upon the believ and sent down soldier angel whom you did not see and punish those who disbelieved. and that is the recompens of the disbelievers.
9|27|then allah will accept repent after that for whom He wills; and allah is forgiv and merciful.
9|28|o you who have believed, inde the polytheist are unclean, so let them not approach al-masjid al-haram after this, their [final] year. and if you fear privation, allah will enrich you from hi bounti if He wills. indeed, allah is know and wise.
9|29|fight those who do not believ in allah or in the last day and who do not consid unlaw what allah and hi messeng have made unlaw and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the scriptur - [fight] until they give the jizyah willingli while they are humbled.
9|30|th jew say, "ezra is the son of allah "; and the christian say, "the messiah is the son of allah." that is their statement from their mouths; they imit the say of those who disbeliev [befor them]. may allah destroy them; how are they deluded?
9|31|they have taken their scholar and monk as lord besid allah, and [also] the messiah, the son of mary. and they were not command except to worship one god; there is no deiti except him. exalt is He abov whatev they associ with him.
9|32|they want to extinguish the light of allah with their mouths, but allah refus except to perfect hi light, although the disbeliev dislik it.
9|33|it is He who ha sent hi messeng with guidanc and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion, although they who associ other with allah dislik it.
9|34|o you who have believed, inde mani of the scholar and the monk devour the wealth of peopl unjustli and avert [them] from the way of allah. and those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in the way of allah - give them tide of a pain punishment.
9|35|th day when it will be heat in the fire of hell and sear therewith will be their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs, [it will be said], "thi is what you hoard for yourselves, so tast what you use to hoard."
9|36|indeed, the number of month with allah is twelv [lunar] month in the regist of allah [from] the day He creat the heaven and the earth; of these, four are sacred. that is the correct religion, so do not wrong yourselv dure them. and fight against the disbeliev collect as they fight against you collectively. and know that allah is with the righteou [who fear him].
9|37|indeed, the postpon [of restrict within sacr months] is an increas in disbelief by which those who have disbeliev are led [further] astray. they make it law one year and unlaw anoth year to correspond to the number made unlaw by allah and [thus] make law what allah ha made unlawful. made pleas to them is the evil of their deeds; and allah doe not guid the disbeliev people.
9|38|o you who have believed, what is [the matter] with you that, when you are told to go forth in the caus of allah, you adher heavili to the earth? are you satisfi with the life of thi world rather than the hereafter? but what is the enjoy of worldli life compar to the hereaft except a [very] little.
9|39|if you do not go forth, He will punish you with a pain punish and will replac you with anoth people, and you will not harm him at all. and allah is over all thing competent.
9|40|if you do not aid the prophet - allah ha alreadi aid him when those who disbeliev had driven him out [of makkah] as one of two, when they were in the cave and he said to hi companion, "do not grieve; inde allah is with us." and allah sent down hi tranquil upon him and support him with angel you did not see and made the word of those who disbeliev the lowest, while the word of allah - that is the highest. and allah is exalt in might and wise.
9|41|go forth, whether light or heavy, and strive with your wealth and your live in the caus of allah. that is better for you, if you onli knew.
9|42|had it been an easi gain and a moder trip, the hypocrit would have follow you, but distant to them wa the journey. and they will swear by allah, "if we were able, we would have gone forth with you," destroy themselv [through fals oaths], and allah know that inde they are liars.
9|43|may allah pardon you, [O muhammad]; whi did you give them permiss [to remain behind]? [you should not have] until it wa evid to you who were truth and you knew [who were] the liars.
9|44|thos who believ in allah and the last day would not ask permiss of you to be excus from strive with their wealth and their lives. and allah is know of those who fear him.
9|45|onli those would ask permiss of you who do not believ in allah and the last day and whose heart have doubted, and they, in their doubt, are hesitating.
9|46|and if they had intend to go forth, they would have prepar for it [some] preparation. but allah dislik their be sent, so He kept them back, and they were told, "remain [behind] with those who remain."
9|47|had they gone forth with you, they would not have increas you except in confusion, and they would have been activ among you, seek [to cause] you fitnah. and among you are avid listen to them. and allah is know of the wrongdoers.
9|48|they had alreadi desir dissens befor and had upset matter for you until the truth came and the ordin of allah appeared, while they were averse.
9|49|and among them is he who says, "permit me [to remain at home] and do not put me to trial." unquestionably, into trial they have fallen. and indeed, hell will encompass the disbelievers.
9|50|if good befal you, it distress them; but if disast strike you, they say, "we took our matter [in hand] before," and turn away while they are rejoicing.
9|51|say, "never will we be struck except by what allah ha decre for us; He is our protector." and upon allah let the believ rely.
9|52|say, "do you await for us except one of the two best thing while we await for you that allah will afflict you with punish from himself or at our hands? So wait; inde we, along with you, are waiting."
9|53|say, "spend willingli or unwillingly; never will it be accept from you. indeed, you have been a defiantli disobedi people."
9|54|and what prevent their expenditur from be accept from them but that they have disbeliev in allah and in hi messeng and that they come not to prayer except while they are lazi and that they do not spend except while they are unwilling.
9|55|so let not their wealth or their children impress you. allah onli intend to punish them through them in worldli life and that their soul should depart [at death] while they are disbelievers.
9|56|and they swear by allah that they are from among you while they are not from among you; but they are a peopl who are afraid.
9|57|if they could find a refug or some cave or ani place to enter [and hide], they would turn to it while they run heedlessly.
9|58|and among them are some who critic you concern the [distribut of] charities. If they are given from them, they approve; but if they are not given from them, at onc they becom angry.
9|59|if onli they had been satisfi with what allah and hi messeng gave them and said, "suffici for us is allah; allah will give us of hi bounty, and [so will] hi messenger; indeed, we are desir toward allah," [it would have been better for them].
9|60|zakah expenditur are onli for the poor and for the needi and for those employ to collect [zakah] and for bring heart togeth [for islam] and for free captiv [or slaves] and for those in debt and for the caus of allah and for the [stranded] travel - an oblig [imposed] by allah. and allah is know and wise.
9|61|and among them are those who abus the prophet and say, "he is an ear." say, "[it is] an ear of good for you that believ in allah and believ the believ and [is] a merci to those who believ among you." and those who abus the messeng of allah - for them is a pain punishment.
9|62|they swear by allah to you [muslims] to satisfi you. but allah and hi messeng are more worthi for them to satisfy, if they should be believers.
9|63|do they not know that whoever oppos allah and hi messeng - that for him is the fire of hell, wherein he will abid eternally? that is the great disgrace.
9|64|they hypocrit are apprehens lest a surah be reveal about them, inform them of what is in their hearts. say, "mock [a you wish]; indeed, allah will expos that which you fear."
9|65|and if you ask them, they will sure say, "we were onli convers and playing." say, "i it allah and hi vers and hi messeng that you were mocking?"
9|66|mak no excuse; you have disbeliev after your belief. If We pardon one faction of you - We will punish anoth faction becaus they were criminals.
9|67|th hypocrit men and hypocrit women are of one another. they enjoin what is wrong and forbid what is right and close their hands. they have forgotten allah, so He ha forgotten them [accordingly]. indeed, the hypocrit - it is they who are the defiantli disobedient.
9|68|allah ha promis the hypocrit men and hypocrit women and the disbeliev the fire of hell, wherein they will abid eternally. It is suffici for them. and allah ha curs them, and for them is an endur punishment.
9|69|[y disbeliev are] like those befor you; they were stronger than you in power and more abund in wealth and children. they enjoy their portion [of worldli enjoyment], and you have enjoy your portion as those befor you enjoy their portion, and you have engag [in vanities] like that in which they engaged. [it is] those whose deed have becom worthless in thi world and in the hereafter, and it is they who are the losers.
9|70|ha there not reach them the news of those befor them - the peopl of noah and [the tribe of] 'aad and thamud and the peopl of abraham and the companion of madyan and the town overturned? their messeng came to them with clear proofs. and allah would never have wrong them, but they were wrong themselves.
9|71|th believ men and believ women are alli of one another. they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and establish prayer and give zakah and obey allah and hi messenger. those - allah will have merci upon them. indeed, allah is exalt in might and wise.
9|72|allah ha promis the believ men and believ women garden beneath which river flow, wherein they abid eternally, and pleasant dwell in garden of perpetu residence; but approv from allah is greater. It is that which is the great attainment.
9|73|o prophet, fight against the disbeliev and the hypocrit and be harsh upon them. and their refug is hell, and wretch is the destination.
9|74|they swear by allah that they did not say [anyth against the prophet] while they had said the word of disbelief and disbeliev after their [pretens of] islam and plan that which they were not to attain. and they were not resent except [for the fact] that allah and hi messeng had enrich them of hi bounty. So if they repent, it is better for them; but if they turn away, allah will punish them with a pain punish in thi world and the hereafter. and there will not be for them on earth ani protector or helper.
9|75|and among them are those who made a coven with allah, [saying], "if He should give us from hi bounty, we will sure spend in charity, and we will sure be among the righteous."
9|76|but when he gave them from hi bounty, they were stingi with it and turn away while they refused.
9|77|so He penal them with hypocrisi in their heart until the day they will meet him - becaus they fail allah in what they promis him and becaus they [habitually] use to lie.
9|78|did they not know that allah know their secret and their privat convers and that allah is the knower of the unseen?
9|79|thos who critic the contributor among the believ concern [their] chariti and [criticize] the one who find noth [to spend] except their effort, so they ridicul them - allah will ridicul them, and they will have a pain punishment.
9|80|ask forgiv for them, [O muhammad], or do not ask forgiv for them. If you should ask forgiv for them seventi time - never will allah forgiv them. that is becaus they disbeliev in allah and hi messenger, and allah doe not guid the defiantli disobedi people.
9|81|thos who remain behind rejoic in their stay [at home] after [the departur of] the messeng of allah and dislik to strive with their wealth and their live in the caus of allah and said, "do not go forth in the heat." say, "the fire of hell is more intens in heat" - if they would but understand.
9|82|so let them laugh a littl and [then] weep much as recompens for what they use to earn.
9|83|if allah should return you to a faction of them [after the expedition] and then they ask your permiss to go out [to battle], say, "you will not go out with me, ever, and you will never fight with me an enemy. indeed, you were satisfi with sit [at home] the first time, so sit [now] with those who stay behind."
9|84|and do not pray [the funer prayer, O muhammad], over ani of them who ha die - ever - or stand at hi grave. indeed, they disbeliev in allah and hi messeng and die while they were defiantli disobedient.
9|85|and let not their wealth and their children impress you. allah onli intend to punish them through them in thi world and that their soul should depart [at death] while they are disbelievers.
9|86|and when a surah wa reveal [enjoin them] to believ in allah and to fight with hi messenger, those of wealth among them ask your permiss [to stay back] and said, "leav us to be with them who sit [at home]."
9|87|they were satisfi to be with those who stay behind, and their heart were seal over, so they do not understand.
9|88|but the messeng and those who believ with him fought with their wealth and their lives. those will have [all that is] good, and it is those who are the successful.
9|89|allah ha prepar for them garden beneath which river flow, wherein they will abid eternally. that is the great attainment.
9|90|and those with excus among the bedouin came to be permit [to remain], and they who had lie to allah and hi messeng sat [at home]. there will strike those who disbeliev among them a pain punishment.
9|91|ther is not upon the weak or upon the ill or upon those who do not find anyth to spend ani discomfort when they are sincer to allah and hi messenger. there is not upon the doer of good ani caus [for blame]. and allah is forgiv and merciful.
9|92|nor [i there blame] upon those who, when they came to you that you might give them mounts, you said, "I can find noth for you to ride upon." they turn back while their eye overflow with tear out of grief that they could not find someth to spend [for the caus of allah].
9|93|th caus [for blame] is onli upon those who ask permiss of you while they are rich. they are satisfi to be with those who stay behind, and allah ha seal over their hearts, so they do not know.
9|94|they will make excus to you when you have return to them. say, "make no excus - never will we believ you. allah ha alreadi inform us of your news. and allah will observ your deeds, and [so will] hi messenger; then you will be taken back to the knower of the unseen and the witnessed, and He will inform you of what you use to do."
9|95|they will swear by allah to you when you return to them that you would leav them alone. So leav them alone; inde they are evil; and their refug is hell as recompens for what they had been earning.
9|96|they swear to you so that you might be satisfi with them. but if you should be satisfi with them - indeed, allah is not satisfi with a defiantli disobedi people.
9|97|th bedouin are stronger in disbelief and hypocrisi and more like not to know the limit of what [laws] allah ha reveal to hi messenger. and allah is know and wise.
9|98|and among the bedouin are some who consid what they spend as a loss and await for you turn of misfortune. upon them will be a misfortun of evil. and allah is hear and knowing.
9|99|but among the bedouin are some who believ in allah and the last day and consid what they spend as mean of near to allah and of [obtaining] invoc of the messenger. unquestionably, it is a mean of near for them. allah will admit them to hi mercy. indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
9|100|and the first forerunn [in the faith] among the muhajireen and the ansar and those who follow them with good conduct - allah is pleas with them and they are pleas with him, and He ha prepar for them garden beneath which river flow, wherein they will abid forever. that is the great attainment.
9|101|and among those around you of the bedouin are hypocrites, and [also] from the peopl of madinah. they have becom accustom to hypocrisy. you, [O muhammad], do not know them, [but] We know them. We will punish them twice [in thi world]; then they will be return to a great punishment.
9|102|and [there are] other who have acknowledg their sins. they had mix a righteou deed with anoth that wa bad. perhap allah will turn to them in forgiveness. indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
9|103|take, [o, muhammad], from their wealth a chariti by which you purifi them and caus them increase, and invok [allah 's blessings] upon them. indeed, your invoc are reassur for them. and allah is hear and knowing.
9|104|do they not know that it is allah who accept repent from hi servant and receiv chariti and that it is allah who is the accept of repentance, the merciful?
9|105|and say, "do [a you will], for allah will see your deeds, and [so, will] hi messeng and the believers. and you will be return to the knower of the unseen and the witnessed, and He will inform you of what you use to do."
9|106|and [there are] other defer until the command of allah - whether He will punish them or whether He will forgiv them. and allah is know and wise.
9|107|and [there are] those [hypocrites] who took for themselv a mosqu for caus harm and disbelief and divis among the believ and as a station for whoever had war against allah and hi messeng before. and they will sure swear, "we intend onli the best." and allah testifi that inde they are liars.
9|108|do not stand [for prayer] within it - ever. A mosqu found on righteous from the first day is more worthi for you to stand in. within it are men who love to purifi themselves; and allah love those who purifi themselves.
9|109|then is one who laid the foundat of hi build on righteous [with fear] from allah and [seeking] hi approv better or one who laid the foundat of hi build on the edg of a bank about to collapse, so it collaps with him into the fire of hell? and allah doe not guid the wrongdo people.
9|110|their build which they built will not ceas to be a [caus of] skeptic in their heart until their heart are stopped. and allah is know and wise.
9|111|indeed, allah ha purchas from the believ their live and their properti [in exchange] for that they will have paradise. they fight in the caus of allah, so they kill and are killed. [it is] a true promis [binding] upon him in the torah and the gospel and the qur'an. and who is truer to hi coven than allah? So rejoic in your transact which you have contracted. and it is that which is the great attainment.
9|112|[such believ are] the repentant, the worshippers, the praiser [of allah], the travel [for hi cause], those who bow and prostrat [in prayer], those who enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and those who observ the limit [set by] allah. and give good tide to the believers.
9|113|it is not for the prophet and those who have believ to ask forgiv for the polytheists, even if they were relatives, after it ha becom clear to them that they are companion of hellfire.
9|114|and the request of forgiv of abraham for hi father wa onli becaus of a promis he had made to him. but when it becam appar to abraham that hi father wa an enemi to allah, he disassoci himself from him. inde wa abraham compassion and patient.
9|115|and allah would not let a peopl stray after He ha guid them until He make clear to them what they should avoid. indeed, allah is know of all things.
9|116|indeed, to allah belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth; He give life and caus death. and you have not besid allah ani protector or ani helper.
9|117|allah ha alreadi forgiven the prophet and the muhajireen and the ansar who follow him in the hour of difficulti after the heart of a parti of them had almost inclin [to doubt], and then He forgav them. indeed, He wa to them kind and merciful.
9|118|and [he also forgave] the three who were left behind [and regret their error] to the point that the earth close in on them in spite of it vast and their soul confin them and they were certain that there is no refug from allah except in him. then He turn to them so they could repent. indeed, allah is the accept of repentance, the merciful.
9|119|o you who have believed, fear allah and be with those who are true.
9|120|it wa not [proper] for the peopl of madinah and those surround them of the bedouin that they remain behind after [the departur of] the messeng of allah or that they prefer themselv over hi self. that is becaus they are not afflict by thirst or fatigu or hunger in the caus of allah, nor do they tread on ani ground that enrag the disbelievers, nor do they inflict upon an enemi ani inflict but that is regist for them as a righteou deed. indeed, allah doe not allow to be lost the reward of the doer of good.
9|121|nor do they spend an expenditure, small or large, or cross a valley but that it is regist for them that allah may reward them for the best of what they were doing.
9|122|and it is not for the believ to go forth [to battle] all at once. for there should separ from everi divis of them a group [remaining] to obtain understand in the religion and warn their peopl when they return to them that they might be cautious.
9|123|o you who have believed, fight those adjac to you of the disbeliev and let them find in you harshness. and know that allah is with the righteous.
9|124|and whenev a surah is revealed, there are among the hypocrit those who say, "which of you ha thi increas faith?" As for those who believed, it ha increas them in faith, while they are rejoicing.
9|125|but as for those in whose heart is disease, it ha [only] increas them in evil [in addition] to their evil. and they will have die while they are disbelievers.
9|126|do they not see that they are tri everi year onc or twice but then they do not repent nor do they remember?
9|127|and whenev a surah is revealed, they look at each other, [saying], "doe anyon see you?" and then they dismiss themselves. allah ha dismiss their heart becaus they are a peopl who do not understand.
9|128|ther ha certainli come to you a messeng from among yourselves. grievou to him is what you suffer; [he is] concern over you and to the believ is kind and merciful.
9|129|but if they turn away, [O muhammad], say, "suffici for me is allah; there is no deiti except him. On him I have relied, and He is the lord of the great throne."
10|1|alif, lam, ra. these are the vers of the wise book
10|2|hav the peopl been amaz that We reveal [revelation] to a man from among them, [saying], "warn mankind and give good tide to those who believ that they will have a [firm] preced of honor with their lord"? [but] the disbeliev say, "indeed, thi is an obviou magician."
10|3|indeed, your lord is allah, who creat the heaven and the earth in six day and then establish himself abov the throne, arrang the matter [of hi creation]. there is no intercessor except after hi permission. that is allah, your lord, so worship him. then will you not remember?
10|4|to him is your return all together. [it is] the promis of allah [which is] truth. indeed, He begin the [process of] creation and then repeat it that He may reward those who have believ and done righteou deeds, in justice. but those who disbeliev will have a drink of scald water and a pain punish for what they use to deny.
10|5|it is He who made the sun a shine light and the moon a deriv light and determin for it phase - that you may know the number of year and account [of time]. allah ha not creat thi except in truth. He detail the sign for a peopl who know
10|6|indeed, in the altern of the night and the day and [in] what allah ha creat in the heaven and the earth are sign for a peopl who fear allah
10|7|indeed, those who do not expect the meet with Us and are satisfi with the life of thi world and feel secur therein and those who are heedless of our signs
10|8|for those their refug will be the fire becaus of what they use to earn.
10|9|indeed, those who have believ and done righteou deed - their lord will guid them becaus of their faith. beneath them river will flow in the garden of pleasure
10|10|their call therein will be, "exalt are you, O allah," and their greet therein will be, "peace." and the last of their call will be, "prais to allah, lord of the worlds!"
10|11|and if allah wa to hasten for the peopl the evil [they invoke] as He hasten for them the good, their term would have been end for them. but We leav the one who do not expect the meet with us, in their transgression, wander blindly
10|12|and when afflict touch man, he call upon us, whether lie on hi side or sit or standing; but when We remov from him hi affliction, he continu [in disobedience] as if he had never call upon Us to [remove] an afflict that touch him. thu is made pleas to the transgressor that which they have been doing
10|13|and We had alreadi destroy gener befor you when they wronged, and their messeng had come to them with clear proofs, but they were not to believe. thu do We recompens the crimin people
10|14|then We made you successor in the land after them so that We may observ how you will do.
10|15|and when our vers are recit to them as clear evidences, those who do not expect the meet with Us say, "bring us a qur'an other than thi or chang it." say, [O muhammad], "it is not for me to chang it on my own accord. I onli follow what is reveal to me. inde I fear, if I should disobey my lord, the punish of a tremend day."
10|16|say, "if allah had willed, I would not have recit it to you, nor would He have made it known to you, for I had remain among you a lifetim befor it. then will you not reason?"
10|17|so who is more unjust than he who invent a lie about allah or deni hi signs? indeed, the crimin will not succeed
10|18|and they worship other than allah that which neither harm them nor benefit them, and they say, "these are our intercessor with allah " say, "do you inform allah of someth He doe not know in the heaven or on the earth?" exalt is He and high abov what they associ with him
10|19|and mankind wa not but one commun [unit in religion], but [then] they differed. and if not for a word that preced from your lord, it would have been judg between them [immediately] concern that over which they differ.
10|20|and they say, "whi is a sign not sent down to him from hi lord?" So say, "the unseen is onli for allah [to administer], so wait; indeed, I am with you among those who wait."
10|21|and when We give the peopl a tast of merci after advers ha touch them, at onc they conspir against our verses. say, "allah is swifter in strategy." indeed, our messeng record that which you conspire
10|22|it is He who enabl you to travel on land and sea until, when you are in ship and they sail with them by a good wind and they rejoic therein, there come a storm wind and the wave come upon them from everywher and they assum that they are surrounded, supplic allah, sincer to him in religion, "if you should save us from this, we will sure be among the thankful."
10|23|but when He save them, at onc they commit injustic upon the earth without right. O mankind, your injustic is onli against yourselves, [be merely] the enjoy of worldli life. then to Us is your return, and We will inform you of what you use to do.
10|24|th exampl of [this] worldli life is but like rain which We have sent down from the sky that the plant of the earth absorb - [those] from which men and livestock eat - until, when the earth ha taken on it adorn and is beautifi and it peopl suppos that they have capabl over it, there come to it our command by night or by day, and We make it as a harvest, as if it had not flourish yesterday. thu do We explain in detail the sign for a peopl who give thought.
10|25|and allah invit to the home of peac and guid whom He will to a straight path
10|26|for them who have done good is the best [reward] and extra. No dark will cover their faces, nor humiliation. those are companion of paradise; they will abid therein eternally
10|27|but they who have earn [blame for] evil do - the recompens of an evil deed is it equivalent, and humili will cover them. they will have from allah no protector. It will be as if their face are cover with piec of the night - so dark [are they]. those are the companion of the fire; they will abid therein eternally.
10|28|and [mention, O muhammad], the day We will gather them all togeth - then We will say to those who associ other with allah, "[remain in] your place, you and your 'partners.' " then We will separ them, and their "partners" will say, "you did not use to worship us,
10|29|and suffici is allah as a wit between us and you that we were of your worship unaware."
10|30|there, [on that day], everi soul will be put to trial for what it did previously, and they will be return to allah, their master, the truth, and lost from them is whatev they use to invent.
10|31|say, "who provid for you from the heaven and the earth? Or who control hear and sight and who bring the live out of the dead and bring the dead out of the live and who arrang [every] matter?" they will say, "allah," so say, "then will you not fear him?"
10|32|for that is allah, your lord, the truth. and what can be beyond truth except error? So how are you averted?
10|33|thu the word of your lord ha come into effect upon those who defiantli disobey - that they will not believe.
10|34|say, "are there of your 'partners' ani who begin creation and then repeat it?" say, "allah begin creation and then repeat it, so how are you deluded?"
10|35|say, "are there of your 'partners' ani who guid to the truth?" say, "allah guid to the truth. So is He who guid to the truth more worthi to be follow or he who guid not unless he is guided? then what is [wrong] with you - how do you judge?"
10|36|and most of them follow not except assumption. indeed, assumpt avail not against the truth at all. indeed, allah is know of what they do.
10|37|and it wa not [possible] for thi qur'an to be produc by other than allah, but [it is] a confirm of what wa befor it and a detail explan of the [former] scripture, about which there is no doubt, from the lord of the worlds.
10|38|or do they say [about the prophet], "he invent it?" say, "then bring forth a surah like it and call upon [for assistance] whomev you can besid allah, if you should be truthful."
10|39|rather, they have deni that which they encompass not in knowledg and whose interpret ha not yet come to them. thu did those befor them deny. then observ how wa the end of the wrongdoers.
10|40|and of them are those who believ in it, and of them are those who do not believ in it. and your lord is most know of the corrupters
10|41|and if they deni you, [O muhammad], then say, "for me are my deeds, and for you are your deeds. you are disassoci from what I do, and I am disassoci from what you do."
10|42|and among them are those who listen to you. but can you caus the deaf to hear, although they will not use reason?
10|43|and among them are those who look at you. but can you guid the blind although they will not [attempt to] see?
10|44|indeed, allah doe not wrong the peopl at all, but it is the peopl who are wrong themselves.
10|45|and on the day when He will gather them, [it will be] as if they had not remain [in the world] but an hour of the day, [and] they will know each other. those will have lost who deni the meet with allah and were not guided
10|46|and whether We show you some of what We promis them, [O muhammad], or We take you in death, to Us is their return; then, [either way], allah is a wit concern what they are doing
10|47|and for everi nation is a messenger. So when their messeng comes, it will be judg between them in justice, and they will not be wronged
10|48|and they say, "when is [the fulfil of] thi promise, if you should be truthful?"
10|49|say, "I possess not for myself ani harm or benefit except what allah should will. for everi nation is a [specified] term. when their time ha come, then they will not remain behind an hour, nor will they preced [it]."
10|50|say, "have you considered: if hi punish should come to you by night or by day - for which [aspect] of it would the crimin be impatient?"
10|51|then is it that when it ha [actually] occur you will believ in it? now? and you were [once] for it impatient
10|52|then it will be said to those who had wronged, "tast the punish of eternity; are you be recompens except for what you use to earn?"
10|53|and they ask inform of you, [O muhammad], "i it true?" say, "yes, by my lord. indeed, it is truth; and you will not caus failur [to allah]."
10|54|and if each soul that wrong had everyth on earth, it would offer it in ransom. and they will confid regret when they see the punishment; and they will be judg in justice, and they will not be wronged
10|55|unquestionably, to allah belong whatev is in the heaven and the earth. unquestionably, the promis of allah is truth, but most of them do not know
10|56|h give life and caus death, and to him you will be returned
10|57|o mankind, there ha to come to you instruct from your lord and heal for what is in the breast and guidanc and merci for the believers.
10|58|say, "in the bounti of allah and in hi merci - in that let them rejoice; it is better than what they accumulate."
10|59|say, "have you seen what allah ha sent down to you of provis of which you have made [some] law and [some] unlawful?" say, "ha allah permit you [to do so], or do you invent [something] about allah?"
10|60|and what will be the supposit of those who invent falsehood about allah on the day of resurrection? indeed, allah is full of bounti to the people, but most of them are not grateful."
10|61|and, [O muhammad], you are not [engaged] in ani matter or recit ani of the qur'an and you [people] do not do ani deed except that We are wit over you when you are involv in it. and not absent from your lord is ani [part] of an atom' weight within the earth or within the heaven or [anything] smaller than that or greater but that it is in a clear register.
10|62|unquestionably, [for] the alli of allah there will be no fear concern them, nor will they grieve
10|63|thos who believ and were fear allah
10|64|for them are good tide in the worldli life and in the hereafter. No chang is there in the word of allah. that is what is the great attainment.
10|65|and let not their speech griev you. indeed, honor [due to power] belong to allah entirely. He is the hearing, the knowing.
10|66|unquestionably, to allah belong whoever is in the heaven and whoever is on the earth. and those who invok other than allah do not [actually] follow [his] "partners." they follow not except assumption, and they are not but falsifying
10|67|it is He who made for you the night to rest therein and the day, give sight. inde in that are sign for a peopl who listen.
10|68|they have said, "allah ha taken a son." exalt is he; He is the [one] free of need. To him belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is in the earth. you have no author for thi [claim]. Do you say about allah that which you do not know?
10|69|say, "indeed, those who invent falsehood about allah will not succeed."
10|70|[for them is brief] enjoy in thi world; then to Us is their return; then We will make them tast the sever punish becaus they use to disbelieve
10|71|and recit to them the news of noah, when he said to hi people, "O my people, if my resid and my remind of the sign of allah ha becom burdensom upon you - then I have reli upon allah. So resolv upon your plan and [call upon] your associates. then let not your plan be obscur to you. then carri it out upon me and do not give me respite.
10|72|and if you turn away [from my advice] then no payment have I ask of you. My reward is onli from allah, and I have been command to be of the muslims."
10|73|and they deni him, so We save him and those with him in the ship and made them successors, and We drown those who deni our signs. then see how wa the end of those who were warned.
10|74|then We sent after him messeng to their peoples, and they came to them with clear proofs. but they were not to believ in that which they had deni before. thu We seal over the heart of the transgressors
10|75|then We sent after them mose and aaron to pharaoh and hi establish with our signs, but they behav arrogantli and were a crimin people
10|76|so when there came to them the truth from us, they said, "indeed, thi is obviou magic."
10|77|mos said, "do you say [thus] about the truth when it ha come to you? Is thi magic? but magician will not succeed."
10|78|they said, "have you come to us to turn us away from that upon which we found our father and so that you two may have grandeur in the land? and we are not believ in you."
10|79|and pharaoh said, "bring to me everi learn magician."
10|80|so when the magician came, mose said to them, "throw down whatev you will throw."
10|81|and when they had thrown, mose said, "what you have brought is [only] magic. indeed, allah will expos it worthlessness. indeed, allah doe not amend the work of corrupters.
10|82|and allah will establish the truth by hi words, even if the crimin dislik it."
10|83|but no one believ moses, except [some] youth among hi people, for fear of pharaoh and hi establish that they would persecut them. and indeed, pharaoh wa haughti within the land, and indeed, he wa of the transgressors
10|84|and mose said, "O my people, if you have believ in allah, then reli upon him, if you should be muslims."
10|85|so they said, "upon allah do we rely. our lord, make us not [object of] trial for the wrongdo people
10|86|and save us by your merci from the disbeliev people."
10|87|and We inspir to mose and hi brother, "settl your peopl in egypt in hous and make your hous [face the] qiblah and establish prayer and give good tide to the believers."
10|88|and mose said, "our lord, inde you have given pharaoh and hi establish splendor and wealth in the worldli life, our lord, that they may lead [men] astray from your way. our lord, obliter their wealth and harden their heart so that they will not believ until they see the pain punishment."
10|89|[allah] said, "your supplic ha been answered." So remain on a right cours and follow not the way of those who do not know."
10|90|and We took the children of israel across the sea, and pharaoh and hi soldier pursu them in tyranni and enmiti until, when drown overtook him, he said, "I believ that there is no deiti except that in whom the children of israel believe, and I am of the muslims."
10|91|now? and you had disobey [him] befor and were of the corrupters?
10|92|so today We will save you in bodi that you may be to those who succeed you a sign. and indeed, mani among the people, of our signs, are heedless
10|93|and We had certainti settl the children of israel in an agreeabl settlement and provid them with good things. and they did not differ until [after] knowledg had come to them. indeed, your lord will judg between them on the day of resurrect concern that over which they use to differ
10|94|so if you are in doubt, [O muhammad], about that which We have reveal to you, then ask those who have been read the scriptur befor you. the truth ha certainli come to you from your lord, so never be among the doubters.
10|95|and never be of those who deni the sign of allah and [thus] be among the losers.
10|96|indeed, those upon whom the word of your lord ha come into effect will not believe,
10|97|even if everi sign should come to them, until they see the pain punishment.
10|98|then ha there not been a [single] citi that believ so it faith benefit it except the peopl of jonah? when they believed, We remov from them the punish of disgrac in worldli life and gave them enjoy for a time.
10|99|and had your lord willed, those on earth would have believ - all of them entirely. then, [O muhammad], would you compel the peopl in order that they becom believers?
10|100|and it is not for a soul to believ except by permiss of allah, and He will place defil upon those who will not use reason.
10|101|say, "observ what is in the heaven and earth." but of no avail will be sign or warner to a peopl who do not believe
10|102|so do they wait except for like [what occur in] the day of those who pass on befor them? say, "then wait; indeed, I am with you among those who wait."
10|103|then We will save our messeng and those who have believed. thus, it is an oblig upon Us that We save the believers
10|104|say, [O muhammad], "O people, if you are in doubt as to my religion - then I do not worship those which you worship besid allah; but I worship allah, who caus your death. and I have been command to be of the believers
10|105|and [commanded], 'direct your face toward the religion, inclin to truth, and never be of those who associ other with allah;
10|106|and do not invok besid allah that which neither benefit you nor harm you, for if you did, then inde you would be of the wrongdoers.'"
10|107|and if allah should touch you with adversity, there is no remov of it except him; and if He intend for you good, then there is no repel of hi bounty. He caus it to reach whom He will of hi servants. and He is the forgiving, the merciful
10|108|say, "O mankind, the truth ha come to you from your lord, so whoever is guid is onli guid for [the benefit of] hi soul, and whoever goe astray onli goe astray [in violation] against it. and I am not over you a manager."
10|109|and follow what is reveal to you, [O muhammad], and be patient until allah will judge. and He is the best of judges.
11|1|alif, lam, ra. [thi is] a book whose vers are perfect and then present in detail from [one who is] wise and acquainted.
11|2|[through a messenger, saying], "do not worship except allah. indeed, I am to you from him a warner and a bringer of good tidings,"
11|3|and [saying], "seek forgiv of your lord and repent to him, [and] He will let you enjoy a good provis for a specifi term and give everi doer of favor hi favor. but if you turn away, then indeed, I fear for you the punish of a great day.
11|4|to allah is your return, and He is over all thing competent."
11|5|unquestionably, they the disbeliev turn away their breast to hide themselv from him. unquestionably, [even] when they cover themselv in their clothing, allah know what they conceal and what they declare. indeed, He is know of that within the breasts.
11|6|and there is no creatur on earth but that upon allah is it provision, and He know it place of dwell and place of storage. all is in a clear register.
11|7|and it is He who creat the heaven and the earth in six day - and hi throne had been upon water - that He might test you as to which of you is best in deed. but if you say, "indeed, you are resurrect after death," those who disbeliev will sure say, "thi is not but obviou magic."
11|8|and if We hold back from them the punish for a limit time, they will sure say, "what detain it?" unquestionably, on the day it come to them, it will not be avert from them, and they will be envelop by what they use to ridicule.
11|9|and if We give man a tast of merci from Us and then We withdraw it from him, indeed, he is despair and ungrateful.
11|10|but if We give him a tast of favor after hardship ha touch him, he will sure say, "bad time have left me." indeed, he is exult and boast -
11|11|except for those who are patient and do righteou deeds; those will have forgiv and great reward.
11|12|then would you possibl leav [out] some of what is reveal to you, or is your breast constrain by it becaus they say, "whi ha there not been sent down to him a treasur or come with him an angel?" but you are onli a warner. and allah is dispos of all things.
11|13|or do they say, "he invent it"? say, "then bring ten surah like it that have been invent and call upon [for assistance] whomev you can besid allah, if you should be truthful."
11|14|and if they do not respond to you - then know that the qur'an wa reveal with the knowledg of allah and that there is no deiti except him. then, would you [not] be muslims?
11|15|whoev desir the life of thi world and it adorn - We fulli repay them for their deed therein, and they therein will not be deprived.
11|16|thos are the one for whom there is not in the hereaft but the fire. and lost is what they did therein, and worthless is what they use to do.
11|17|so is one who [stands] upon a clear evid from hi lord [like the aforementioned]? and a wit from him follow it, and befor it wa the scriptur of mose to lead and as mercy. those [believ in the former revelations] believ in the qur'an. but whoever disbeliev in it from the [various] faction - the fire is hi promis destination. So be not in doubt about it. indeed, it is the truth from your lord, but most of the peopl do not believe.
11|18|and who is more unjust than he who invent a lie about allah? those will be present befor their lord, and the wit will say, "these are the one who lie against their lord." unquestionably, the curs of allah is upon the wrongdoers.
11|19|who avert [people] from the way of allah and sought to make it [seem] deviant while they, concern the hereafter, were disbelievers.
11|20|thos were not caus failur [to allah] on earth, nor did they have besid allah ani protectors. for them the punish will be multiplied. they were not abl to hear, nor did they see.
11|21|thos are the one who will have lost themselves, and lost from them is what they use to invent.
11|22|assuredly, it is they in the hereaft who will be the greatest losers.
11|23|indeed, they who have believ and done righteou deed and humbl themselv to their lord - those are the companion of paradise; they will abid etern therein.
11|24|th exampl of the two parti is like the blind and deaf, and the see and hearing. are they equal in comparison? then, will you not remember?
11|25|and We had certainli sent noah to hi people, [saying], "indeed, I am to you a clear warner
11|26|that you not worship except allah. indeed, I fear for you the punish of a pain day."
11|27|so the emin among those who disbeliev from hi peopl said, "we do not see you but as a man like ourselves, and we do not see you follow except by those who are the lowest of us [and] at first suggestion. and we do not see in you over us ani merit; rather, we think you are liars."
11|28|h said, "O my peopl have you considered: if I should be upon clear evid from my lord while He ha given me merci from himself but it ha been made unappar to you, should we forc it upon you while you are avers to it?
11|29|and O my people, I ask not of you for it ani wealth. My reward is not but from allah. and I am not one to drive away those who have believed. indeed, they will meet their lord, but I see that you are a peopl behav ignorantly.
11|30|and O my people, who would protect me from allah if I drove them away? then will you not be reminded?
11|31|and I do not tell you that I have the depositori [contain the provision] of allah or that I know the unseen, nor do I tell you that I am an angel, nor do I say of those upon whom your eye look down that allah will never grant them ani good. allah is most know of what is within their souls. indeed, I would then be among the wrongdoers."
11|32|they said, "O noah, you have disput us and been frequent in disput of us. So bring us what you threaten us, if you should be of the truthful."
11|33|h said, "allah will onli bring it to you if He wills, and you will not caus [him] failure.
11|34|and my advic will not benefit you - although I wish to advis you - If allah should intend to put you in error. He is your lord, and to him you will be returned."
11|35|or do they say [about prophet muhammad], "he invent it"? say, "if I have invent it, then upon me is [the consequ of] my crime; but I am innoc of what [crimes] you commit."
11|36|and it wa reveal to noah that, "no one will believ from your peopl except those who have alreadi believed, so do not be distress by what they have been doing.
11|37|and construct the ship under our observ and our inspir and do not address Me concern those who have wronged; indeed, they are [to be] drowned."
11|38|and he construct the ship, and whenev an assembl of the emin of hi peopl pass by him, they ridicul him. He said, "if you ridicul us, then we will ridicul you just as you ridicule.
11|39|and you are go to know who will get a punish that will disgrac him [on earth] and upon whom will descend an endur punish [in the hereafter]."
11|40|[so it was], until when our command came and the oven overflowed, We said, "load upon the ship of each [creature] two mate and your family, except those about whom the word ha preceded, and [include] whoever ha believed." but none had believ with him, except a few.
11|41|and [noah] said, "embark therein; in the name of allah is it cours and it anchorage. indeed, my lord is forgiv and merciful."
11|42|and it sail with them through wave like mountains, and noah call to hi son who wa apart [from them], "O my son, come aboard with us and be not with the disbelievers."
11|43|[but] he said, "I will take refug on a mountain to protect me from the water." [noah] said, "there is no protector today from the decre of allah, except for whom He give mercy." and the wave came between them, and he wa among the drowned.
11|44|and it wa said, "O earth, swallow your water, and O sky, withhold [your rain]." and the water subsided, and the matter wa accomplished, and the ship came to rest on the [mountain of] judiyy. and it wa said, "away with the wrongdo people."
11|45|and noah call to hi lord and said, "mi lord, inde my son is of my family; and indeed, your promis is true; and you are the most just of judges!"
11|46|h said, "O noah, inde he is not of your family; indeed, he is [one whose] work wa other than righteous, so ask Me not for that about which you have no knowledge. indeed, I advis you, lest you be among the ignorant."
11|47|[noah] said, "mi lord, I seek refug in you from ask that of which I have no knowledge. and unless you forgiv me and have merci upon me, I will be among the losers."
11|48|it wa said, "O noah, disembark in secur from Us and bless upon you and upon nation [descending] from those with you. but other nation [of them] We will grant enjoyment; then there will touch them from Us a pain punishment."
11|49|that is from the news of the unseen which We reveal to you, [O muhammad]. you knew it not, neither you nor your people, befor this. So be patient; indeed, the [best] outcom is for the righteous.
11|50|and to 'aad [we sent] their brother hud. He said, "O my people, worship allah; you have no deiti other than him. you are not but inventor [of falsehood].
11|51|o my people, I do not ask you for it ani reward. My reward is onli from the one who creat me. then will you not reason?
11|52|and O my people, ask forgiv of your lord and then repent to him. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in shower and increas you in strength [added] to your strength. and do not turn away, [being] criminals."
11|53|they said, "O hud, you have not brought us clear evidence, and we are not one to leav our god on your say-so. nor are we believ in you.
11|54|w onli say that some of our god have possess you with evil." He said, "indeed, I call allah to witness, and wit [yourselves] that I am free from whatev you associ with allah
11|55|oth than him. So plot against me all together; then do not give me respite.
11|56|indeed, I have reli upon allah, my lord and your lord. there is no creatur but that He hold it forelock. indeed, my lord is on a path [that is] straight."
11|57|but if they turn away, [say], "I have alreadi convey that with which I wa sent to you. My lord will give success to a peopl other than you, and you will not harm him at all. inde my lord is, over all things, guardian."
11|58|and when our command came, We save hud and those who believ with him, by merci from us; and We save them from a harsh punishment.
11|59|and that wa 'aad, who reject the sign of their lord and disobey hi messeng and follow the order of everi obstin tyrant.
11|60|and they were [therefore] follow in thi world with a curs and [a well] on the day of resurrection. unquestionably, 'aad deni their lord; then away with 'aad, the peopl of hud.
11|61|and to thamud [we sent] their brother salih. He said, "O my people, worship allah; you have no deiti other than him. He ha produc you from the earth and settl you in it, so ask forgiv of him and then repent to him. indeed, my lord is near and responsive."
11|62|they said, "O salih, you were among us a man of promis befor this. Do you forbid us to worship what our father worshipped? and inde we are, about that to which you invit us, in disquiet doubt."
11|63|h said, "O my people, have you considered: if I should be upon clear evid from my lord and He ha given me merci from himself, who would protect me from allah if I disobey him? So you would not increas me except in loss.
11|64|and O my people, thi is the she-camel of allah - [she is] to you a sign. So let her feed upon allah 's earth and do not touch her with harm, or you will be taken by an impend punishment."
11|65|but they hamstrung her, so he said, "enjoy yourselv in your home for three days. that is a promis not to be denied."
11|66|so when our command came, We save salih and those who believ with him, by merci from us, and [save them] from the disgrac of that day. indeed, it is your lord who is the powerful, the exalt in might.
11|67|and the shriek seiz those who had wronged, and they becam within their home [corpses] fallen prone
11|68|a if they had never prosper therein. unquestionably, thamud deni their lord; then, away with thamud.
11|69|and certainli did our messeng come to abraham with good tidings; they said, "peace." He said, "peace," and did not delay in bring [them] a roast calf.
11|70|but when he saw their hand not reach for it, he distrust them and felt from them apprehension. they said, "fear not. We have been sent to the peopl of lot."
11|71|and hi wife wa standing, and she smiled. then We gave her good tide of isaac and after isaac, jacob.
11|72|sh said, "woe to me! shall I give birth while I am an old woman and this, my husband, is an old man? indeed, thi is an amaz thing!"
11|73|they said, "are you amaz at the decre of allah? may the merci of allah and hi bless be upon you, peopl of the house. indeed, He is praiseworthi and honorable."
11|74|and when the fright had left abraham and the good tide had reach him, he began to argu with Us concern the peopl of lot.
11|75|indeed, abraham wa forbearing, griev and [frequently] return [to allah].
11|76|[th angel said], "O abraham, give up thi [plea]. indeed, the command of your lord ha come, and indeed, there will reach them a punish that cannot be repelled."
11|77|and when our messengers, [the angels], came to lot, he wa anguish for them and felt for them great discomfort and said, "thi is a tri day."
11|78|and hi peopl came hasten to him, and befor [this] they had been do evil deeds. He said, "O my people, these are my daughters; they are purer for you. So fear allah and do not disgrac me concern my guests. Is there not among you a man of reason?"
11|79|they said, "you have alreadi known that we have not concern your daughter ani claim, and indeed, you know what we want."
11|80|h said, "if onli I had against you some power or could take refug in a strong support."
11|81|th angel said, "O lot, inde we are messeng of your lord; [therefore], they will never reach you. So set out with your famili dure a portion of the night and let not ani among you look back - except your wife; indeed, she will be struck by that which strike them. indeed, their appoint is [for] the morning. Is not the morn near?"
11|82|so when our command came, We made the highest part [of the city] it lowest and rain upon them stone of layer hard clay, [which were]
11|83|mark from your lord. and allah 's punish is not from the wrongdoer [very] far.
11|84|and to madyan [we sent] their brother shu'ayb. He said, "O my people, worship allah; you have no deiti other than him. and do not decreas from the measur and the scale. indeed, I see you in prosperity, but indeed, I fear for you the punish of an all-encompass day.
11|85|and O my people, give full measur and weight in justic and do not depriv the peopl of their due and do not commit abus on the earth, spread corruption.
11|86|what remain [lawful] from allah is best for you, if you would be believers. but I am not a guardian over you."
11|87|they said, "O shu'ayb, doe your prayer command you that we should leav what our father worship or not do with our wealth what we please? indeed, you are the forbearing, the discerning!"
11|88|h said, "O my people, have you considered: if I am upon clear evid from my lord and He ha provid me with a good provis from him...? and I do not intend to differ from you in that which I have forbidden you; I onli intend reform as much as I am able. and my success is not but through allah. upon him I have relied, and to him I return.
11|89|and O my people, let not [your] dissens from me caus you to be struck by that similar to what struck the peopl of noah or the peopl of hud or the peopl of salih. and the peopl of lot are not from you far away.
11|90|and ask forgiv of your lord and then repent to him. indeed, my lord is merci and affectionate."
11|91|they said, "O shu'ayb, we do not understand much of what you say, and indeed, we consid you among us as weak. and if not for your family, we would have stone you [to death]; and you are not to us one respected."
11|92|h said, "O my people, is my famili more respect for power by you than allah? but you put him behind your back [in neglect]. indeed, my lord is encompass of what you do.
11|93|and O my people, work accord to your position; indeed, I am working. you are go to know to whom will come a punish that will disgrac him and who is a liar. So watch; indeed, I am with you a watcher, [await the outcome]."
11|94|and when our command came, We save shu'ayb and those who believ with him, by merci from us. and the shriek seiz those who had wronged, and they becam within their home [corpses] fallen prone
11|95|a if they had never prosper therein. then, away with madyan as thamud wa taken away.
11|96|and We did certainli send mose with our sign and a clear authority
11|97|to pharaoh and hi establishment, but they follow the command of pharaoh, and the command of pharaoh wa not [at all] discerning.
11|98|h will preced hi peopl on the day of resurrect and lead them into the fire; and wretch is the place to which they are led.
11|99|and they were follow in thi [world] with a curs and on the day of resurrection. and wretch is the gift which is given.
11|100|that is from the news of the cities, which We relat to you; of them, some are [still] stand and some are [as] a harvest [mow down].
11|101|and We did not wrong them, but they wrong themselves. and they were not avail at all by their god which they invok other than allah when there came the command of your lord. and they did not increas them in other than ruin.
11|102|and thu is the seizur of your lord when He seiz the citi while they are commit wrong. indeed, hi seizur is pain and severe.
11|103|inde in that is a sign for those who fear the punish of the hereafter. that is a day for which the peopl will be collected, and that is a day [which will be] witnessed.
11|104|and We do not delay it except for a limit term.
11|105|th day it come no soul will speak except by hi permission. and among them will be the wretch and the prosperous.
11|106|a for those who were [destin to be] wretched, they will be in the fire. for them therein is [violent] exhal and inhaling.
11|107|[they will be] abid therein as long as the heaven and the earth endure, except what your lord should will. indeed, your lord is an effect of what He intends.
11|108|and as for those who were [destin to be] prosperous, they will be in paradise, abid therein as long as the heaven and the earth endure, except what your lord should will - a bestow uninterrupted.
11|109|so do not be in doubt, [O muhammad], as to what these [polytheists] are worshipping. they worship not except as their father worship before. and indeed, We will give them their share undiminished.
11|110|and We had certainli given mose the scripture, but it came under disagreement. and if not for a word that preced from your lord, it would have been judg between them. and inde they are, concern the qur'an, in disquiet doubt.
11|111|and indeed, each [of the believ and disbelievers] - your lord will fulli compens them for their deeds. indeed, He is acquaint with what they do.
11|112|so remain on a right cours as you have been commanded, [you] and those who have turn back with you [to allah], and do not transgress. indeed, He is see of what you do.
11|113|and do not inclin toward those who do wrong, lest you be touch by the fire, and you would not have other than allah ani protectors; then you would not be helped.
11|114|and establish prayer at the two end of the day and at the approach of the night. indeed, good deed do away with misdeeds. that is a remind for those who remember.
11|115|and be patient, for indeed, allah doe not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.
11|116|so whi were there not among the gener befor you those of endur discrimin forbid corrupt on earth - except a few of those We save from among them? but those who wrong pursu what luxuri they were given therein, and they were criminals.
11|117|and your lord would not have destroy the citi unjustli while their peopl were reformers.
11|118|and if your lord had willed, He could have made mankind one community; but they will not ceas to differ.
11|119|except whom your lord ha given mercy, and for that He creat them. but the word of your lord is to be fulfil that, "I will sure fill hell with jinn and men all together."
11|120|and each [story] We relat to you from the news of the messeng is that by which We make firm your heart. and there ha come to you, in this, the truth and an instruct and a remind for the believers.
11|121|and say to those who do not believe, "work accord to your position; indeed, we are working.
11|122|and wait, indeed, we are waiting."
11|123|and to allah belong the unseen [aspects] of the heaven and the earth and to him will be return the matter, all of it, so worship him and reli upon him. and your lord is not unawar of that which you do.
12|1|alif, lam, ra. these are the vers of the clear book.
12|2|indeed, We have sent it down as an arab qur'an that you might understand.
12|3|w relat to you, [O muhammad], the best of stori in what We have reveal to you of thi qur'an although you were, befor it, among the unaware.
12|4|[of these stori mention] when joseph said to hi father, "O my father, inde I have seen [in a dream] eleven star and the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrat to me."
12|5|h said, "O my son, do not relat your vision to your brother or they will contriv against you a plan. inde satan, to man, is a manifest enemy.
12|6|and thu will your lord choos you and teach you the interpret of narr and complet hi favor upon you and upon the famili of jacob, as He complet it upon your father before, abraham and isaac. indeed, your lord is know and wise."
12|7|certainli were there in joseph and hi brother sign for those who ask,
12|8|when they said, "joseph and hi brother are more belov to our father than we, while we are a clan. indeed, our father is in clear error.
12|9|kil joseph or cast him out to [another] land; the counten of your father will [then] be onli for you, and you will be after that a righteou people."
12|10|said a speaker among them, "do not kill joseph but throw him into the bottom of the well; some travel will pick him up - if you would do [something]."
12|11|they said, "O our father, whi do you not entrust us with joseph while indeed, we are to him sincer counselors?
12|12|send him with us tomorrow that he may eat well and play. and indeed, we will be hi guardians.
12|13|[jacob] said, "indeed, it sadden me that you should take him, and I fear that a wolf would eat him while you are of him unaware."
12|14|they said, "if a wolf should eat him while we are a [strong] clan, indeed, we would then be losers."
12|15|so when they took him [out] and agre to put him into the bottom of the well... but We inspir to him, "you will sure inform them [someday] about thi affair of their while they do not perceiv [your identity]."
12|16|and they came to their father at night, weeping.
12|17|they said, "O our father, inde we went race each other and left joseph with our possessions, and a wolf ate him. but you would not believ us, even if we were truthful."
12|18|and they brought upon hi shirt fals blood. [jacob] said, "rather, your soul have entic you to something, so patienc is most fitting. and allah is the one sought for help against that which you describe."
12|19|and there came a compani of travelers; then they sent their water drawer, and he let down hi bucket. He said, "good news! here is a boy." and they conceal him, [take him] as merchandise; and allah wa know of what they did.
12|20|and they sold him for a reduc price - a few dirham - and they were, concern him, of those content with little.
12|21|and the one from egypt who bought him said to hi wife, "make hi resid comfortable. perhap he will benefit us, or we will adopt him as a son." and thus, We establish joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpret of events. and allah is predomin over hi affair, but most of the peopl do not know.
12|22|and when joseph reach maturity, We gave him judgment and knowledge. and thu We reward the doer of good.
12|23|and she, in whose hous he was, sought to seduc him. she close the door and said, "come, you." He said, "[i seek] the refug of allah. indeed, he is my master, who ha made good my residence. indeed, wrongdoer will not succeed."
12|24|and she certainli determin [to seduce] him, and he would have inclin to her had he not seen the proof of hi lord. and thu [it was] that We should avert from him evil and immorality. indeed, he wa of our chosen servants.
12|25|and they both race to the door, and she tore hi shirt from the back, and they found her husband at the door. she said, "what is the recompens of one who intend evil for your wife but that he be imprison or a pain punishment?"
12|26|[joseph] said, "it wa she who sought to seduc me." and a wit from her famili testified. "if hi shirt is torn from the front, then she ha told the truth, and he is of the liars.
12|27|but if hi shirt is torn from the back, then she ha lied, and he is of the truthful."
12|28|so when her husband saw hi shirt torn from the back, he said, "indeed, it is of the women' plan. indeed, your plan is great.
12|29|joseph, ignor this. and, [mi wife], ask forgiv for your sin. indeed, you were of the sinful."
12|30|and women in the citi said, "the wife of al-'azeez is seek to seduc her slave boy; he ha impass her with love. indeed, we see her [to be] in clear error."
12|31|so when she heard of their scheming, she sent for them and prepar for them a banquet and gave each one of them a knife and said [to joseph], "come out befor them." and when they saw him, they greatli admir him and cut their hand and said, "perfect is allah! thi is not a man; thi is none but a nobl angel."
12|32|sh said, "that is the one about whom you blame me. and I certainli sought to seduc him, but he firmli refused; and if he will not do what I order him, he will sure be imprison and will be of those debased."
12|33|h said, "mi lord, prison is more to my like than that to which they invit me. and if you do not avert from me their plan, I might inclin toward them and [thus] be of the ignorant."
12|34|so hi lord respond to him and avert from him their plan. indeed, He is the hearing, the knowing.
12|35|then it appear to them after they had seen the sign that al-'azeez should sure imprison him for a time.
12|36|and there enter the prison with him two young men. one of them said, "indeed, I have seen myself [in a dream] press wine." the other said, "indeed, I have seen myself carri upon my head [some] bread, from which the bird were eating. inform us of it interpretation; indeed, we see you to be of those who do good."
12|37|h said, "you will not receiv food that is provid to you except that I will inform you of it interpret befor it come to you. that is from what my lord ha taught me. indeed, I have left the religion of a peopl who do not believ in allah, and they, in the hereafter, are disbelievers.
12|38|and I have follow the religion of my fathers, abraham, isaac and jacob. and it wa not for us to associ anyth with allah. that is from the favor of allah upon us and upon the people, but most of the peopl are not grateful.
12|39|o [my] two companion of prison, are separ lord better or allah, the one, the prevailing?
12|40|y worship not besid him except [mere] name you have name them, you and your fathers, for which allah ha sent down no authority. legisl is not but for allah. He ha command that you worship not except him. that is the correct religion, but most of the peopl do not know.
12|41|o two companion of prison, as for one of you, he will give drink to hi master of wine; but as for the other, he will be crucified, and the bird will eat from hi head. the matter ha been decre about which you both inquire."
12|42|and he said to the one whom he knew would go free, "mention me befor your master." but satan made him forget the mention [to] hi master, and joseph remain in prison sever years.
12|43|and [subsequently] the king said, "indeed, I have seen [in a dream] seven fat cow be eaten by seven [that were] lean, and seven green spike [of grain] and other [that were] dry. O emin ones, explain to me my vision, if you should interpret visions."
12|44|they said, "[it is but] a mixtur of fals dreams, and we are not learn in the interpret of dreams."
12|45|but the one who wa freed and rememb after a time said, "I will inform you of it interpretation, so send me forth."
12|46|[h said], "joseph, O man of truth, explain to us about seven fat cow eaten by seven [that were] lean, and seven green spike [of grain] and other [that were] dri - that I may return to the people; perhap they will know [about you]."
12|47|[joseph] said, "you will plant for seven year consecutively; and what you harvest leav in it spikes, except a littl from which you will eat.
12|48|then will come after that seven difficult [years] which will consum what you save for them, except a littl from which you will store.
12|49|then will come after that a year in which the peopl will be given rain and in which they will press [oliv and grapes]."
12|50|and the king said, "bring him to me." but when the messeng came to him, [joseph] said, "return to your master and ask him what is the case of the women who cut their hands. indeed, my lord is know of their plan."
12|51|said [the king to the women], "what wa your condit when you sought to seduc joseph?" they said, "perfect is allah! We know about him no evil." the wife of al-'azeez said, "now the truth ha becom evident. It wa I who sought to seduc him, and indeed, he is of the truthful.
12|52|that is so al-'azeez will know that I did not betray him in [his] absenc and that allah doe not guid the plan of betrayers.
12|53|and I do not acquit myself. indeed, the soul is a persist enjoin of evil, except those upon which my lord ha mercy. indeed, my lord is forgiv and merciful."
12|54|and the king said, "bring him to me; I will appoint him exclus for myself." and when he spoke to him, he said, "indeed, you are today establish [in position] and trusted."
12|55|[joseph] said, "appoint me over the storehous of the land. indeed, I will be a know guardian."
12|56|and thu We establish joseph in the land to settl therein wherev he willed. We touch with our merci whom We will, and We do not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.
12|57|and the reward of the hereaft is better for those who believ and were fear allah.
12|58|and the brother of joseph came [seek food], and they enter upon him; and he recogn them, but he wa to them unknown.
12|59|and when he had furnish them with their supplies, he said, "bring me a brother of your from your father. Do not you see that I give full measur and that I am the best of accommodators?
12|60|but if you do not bring him to me, no measur will there be [hereafter] for you from me, nor will you approach me."
12|61|they said, "we will attempt to dissuad hi father from [keeping] him, and indeed, we will do [it]."
12|62|and [joseph] said to hi servants, "put their merchandis into their saddlebag so they might recogn it when they have gone back to their peopl that perhap they will [again] return."
12|63|so when they return to their father, they said, "O our father, [further] measur ha been deni to us, so send with us our brother [that] we will be given measure. and indeed, we will be hi guardians."
12|64|h said, "should I entrust you with him except [under coercion] as I entrust you with hi brother before? but allah is the best guardian, and He is the most merci of the merciful."
12|65|and when they open their baggage, they found their merchandis return to them. they said, "O our father, what [more] could we desire? thi is our merchandis return to us. and we will obtain suppli for our famili and protect our brother and obtain an increas of a camel' load; that is an easi measurement."
12|66|[jacob] said, "never will I send him with you until you give me a promis by allah that you will bring him [back] to me, unless you should be surround by enemies." and when they had given their promise, he said, "allah, over what we say, is witness."
12|67|and he said, "O my sons, do not enter from one gate but enter from differ gates; and I cannot avail you against [the decre of] allah at all. the decis is onli for allah; upon him I have relied, and upon him let those who would reli [indeed] rely."
12|68|and when they enter from where their father had order them, it did not avail them against allah at all except [it was] a need within the soul of jacob, which he satisfied. and indeed, he wa a possessor of knowledg becaus of what We had taught him, but most of the peopl do not know.
12|69|and when they enter upon joseph, he took hi brother to himself; he said, "indeed, I am your brother, so do not despair over what they use to do [to me]."
12|70|so when he had furnish them with their supplies, he put the [gold measuring] bowl into the bag of hi brother. then an announc call out, "O caravan, inde you are thieves."
12|71|they said while approach them, "what is it you are missing?"
12|72|they said, "we are miss the measur of the king. and for he who produc it is [the reward of] a camel' load, and I am respons for it."
12|73|they said, "bi allah, you have certainli known that we did not come to caus corrupt in the land, and we have not been thieves."
12|74|th accus said, "then what would be it recompens if you should be liars?"
12|75|[th brothers] said, "it recompens is that he in whose bag it is found - he [himself] will be it recompense. thu do we recompens the wrongdoers."
12|76|so he began [the search] with their bag befor the bag of hi brother; then he extract it from the bag of hi brother. thu did We plan for joseph. He could not have taken hi brother within the religion of the king except that allah willed. We rais in degre whom We will, but over everi possessor of knowledg is one [more] knowing.
12|77|they said, "if he steal - a brother of hi ha stolen before." but joseph kept it within himself and did not reveal it to them. He said, "you are wors in position, and allah is most know of what you describe."
12|78|they said, "O 'azeez, inde he ha a father [who is] an old man, so take one of us in place of him. indeed, we see you as a doer of good."
12|79|h said, "[i seek] the refug of allah [to prevent] that we take except him with whom we found our possession. indeed, we would then be unjust."
12|80|so when they had despair of him, they seclud themselv in privat consultation. the eldest of them said, "do you not know that your father ha taken upon you an oath by allah and [that] befor you fail in [your duti to] joseph? So I will never leav [this] land until my father permit me or allah decid for me, and He is the best of judges.
12|81|return to your father and say, "O our father, inde your son ha stolen, and we did not testifi except to what we knew. and we were not wit of the unseen,
12|82|and ask the citi in which we were and the caravan in which we came - and indeed, we are truthful,"
12|83|[jacob] said, "rather, your soul have entic you to something, so patienc is most fitting. perhap allah will bring them to me all together. inde it is He who is the knowing, the wise."
12|84|and he turn away from them and said, "oh, my sorrow over joseph," and hi eye becam white from grief, for he wa [of that] a suppressor.
12|85|they said, "bi allah, you will not ceas rememb joseph until you becom fatal ill or becom of those who perish."
12|86|h said, "I onli complain of my suffer and my grief to allah, and I know from allah that which you do not know.
12|87|o my sons, go and find out about joseph and hi brother and despair not of relief from allah. indeed, no one despair of relief from allah except the disbeliev people."
12|88|so when they enter upon joseph, they said, "O 'azeez, advers ha touch us and our family, and we have come with good poor in quality, but give us full measur and be charit to us. indeed, allah reward the charitable."
12|89|h said, "do you know what you did with joseph and hi brother when you were ignorant?"
12|90|they said, "are you inde joseph?" He said "I am joseph, and thi is my brother. allah ha certainli favor us. indeed, he who fear allah and is patient, then indeed, allah doe not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good."
12|91|they said, "bi allah, certainli ha allah prefer you over us, and indeed, we have been sinners."
12|92|h said, "no blame will there be upon you today. allah will forgiv you; and He is the most merci of the merciful."
12|93|tak this, my shirt, and cast it over the face of my father; he will becom seeing. and bring me your family, all together."
12|94|and when the caravan depart [from egypt], their father said, "indeed, I find the smell of joseph [and would say that he wa alive] if you did not think me weaken in mind."
12|95|they said, "bi allah, inde you are in your [same] old error."
12|96|and when the bearer of good tide arrived, he cast it over hi face, and he return [onc again] seeing. He said, "did I not tell you that I know from allah that which you do not know?"
12|97|they said, "O our father, ask for us forgiv of our sins; indeed, we have been sinners."
12|98|h said, "I will ask forgiv for you from my lord. indeed, it is He who is the forgiving, the merciful."
12|99|and when they enter upon joseph, he took hi parent to himself and said, "enter egypt, allah willing, safe [and secure]."
12|100|and he rais hi parent upon the throne, and they bow to him in prostration. and he said, "O my father, thi is the explan of my vision of before. My lord ha made it reality. and He wa certainli good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you [here] from bedouin life after satan had induc [estrangement] between me and my brothers. indeed, my lord is subtl in what He wills. indeed, it is He who is the knowing, the wise.
12|101|mi lord, you have given me [something] of sovereignti and taught me of the interpret of dreams. creator of the heaven and earth, you are my protector in thi world and in the hereafter. caus me to die a muslim and join me with the righteous."
12|102|that is from the news of the unseen which We reveal, [O muhammad], to you. and you were not with them when they put togeth their plan while they conspired.
12|103|and most of the people, although you strive [for it], are not believers.
12|104|and you do not ask of them for it ani payment. It is not except a remind to the worlds.
12|105|and how mani a sign within the heaven and earth do they pass over while they, therefrom, are turn away.
12|106|and most of them believ not in allah except while they associ other with him.
12|107|then do they feel secur that there will not come to them an overwhelm [aspect] of the punish of allah or that the hour will not come upon them suddenli while they do not perceive?
12|108|say, "thi is my way; I invit to allah with insight, I and those who follow me. and exalt is allah; and I am not of those who associ other with him."
12|109|and We sent not befor you [a messengers] except men to whom We reveal from among the peopl of cities. So have they not travel through the earth and observ how wa the end of those befor them? and the home of the hereaft is best for those who fear allah; then will you not reason?
12|110|[they continued] until, when the messeng despair and were certain that they had been denied, there came to them our victory, and whoever We will wa saved. and our punish cannot be repel from the peopl who are criminals.
12|111|ther wa certainli in their stori a lesson for those of understanding. never wa the qur'an a narrat invented, but a confirm of what wa befor it and a detail explan of all thing and guidanc and merci for a peopl who believe.
13|1|alif, lam, meem, ra. these are the vers of the book; and what ha been reveal to you from your lord is the truth, but most of the peopl do not believe.
13|2|it is allah who erect the heaven without pillar that you [can] see; then He establish himself abov the throne and made subject the sun and the moon, each run [it course] for a specifi term. He arrang [each] matter; He detail the sign that you may, of the meet with your lord, be certain.
13|3|and it is He who spread the earth and place therein firmli set mountain and rivers; and from all of the fruit He made therein two mates; He caus the night to cover the day. inde in that are sign for a peopl who give thought.
13|4|and within the land are neighbor plot and garden of grapevin and crop and palm trees, [growing] sever from a root or otherwise, water with one water; but We make some of them exceed other in [qualiti of] fruit. inde in that are sign for a peopl who reason.
13|5|and if you are astonished, [O muhammad] - then astonish is their saying, "when we are dust, will we inde be [brought] into a new creation?" those are the one who have disbeliev in their lord, and those will have shackl upon their necks, and those are the companion of the fire; they will abid therein eternally.
13|6|they impati urg you to bring about evil befor good, while there ha alreadi occur befor them similar punish [to what they demand]. and indeed, your lord is full of forgiv for the peopl despit their wrongdoing, and indeed, your lord is sever in penalty.
13|7|and those who disbeliev say, "whi ha a sign not been sent down to him from hi lord?" you are onli a warner, and for everi peopl is a guide.
13|8|allah know what everi femal carri and what the womb lose [prematurely] or exceed. and everyth with him is by due measure.
13|9|[h is] knower of the unseen and the witnessed, the grand, the exalted.
13|10|it is the same [to him] concern you whether one conceal [his] speech or one public it and whether one is hidden by night or conspicu [among others] by day.
13|11|for each one are success [angels] befor and behind him who protect him by the decre of allah. indeed, allah will not chang the condit of a peopl until they chang what is in themselves. and when allah intend for a peopl ill, there is no repel it. and there is not for them besid him ani patron.
13|12|it is He who show you lightening, [causing] fear and aspiration, and gener the heavi clouds.
13|13|and the thunder exalt [allah] with prais of him - and the angel [a well] from fear of him - and He send thunderbolt and strike therewith whom He will while they disput about allah; and He is sever in assault.
13|14|to him [alone] is the supplic of truth. and those they call upon besid him do not respond to them with a thing, except as one who stretch hi hand toward water [from afar, call it] to reach hi mouth, but it will not reach it [thus]. and the supplic of the disbeliev is not but in error [i.e. futility].
13|15|and to allah prostrat whoever is within the heaven and the earth, willingli or by compulsion, and their shadow [a well] in the morn and the afternoons.
13|16|say, "who is lord of the heaven and earth?" say, "allah." say, "have you then taken besid him alli not possess [even] for themselv ani benefit or ani harm?" say, "i the blind equival to the seeing? Or is dark equival to light? Or have they attribut to allah partner who creat like hi creation so that the creation [of each] seem similar to them?" say, "allah is the creator of all things, and He is the one, the prevailing."
13|17|h send down from the sky, rain, and valley flow accord to their capacity, and the torrent carri a rise foam. and from that [ore] which they heat in the fire, desir adorn and utensils, is a foam like it. thu allah present [the exampl of] truth and falsehood. As for the foam, it vanishes, [being] cast off; but as for that which benefit the people, it remain on the earth. thu doe allah present examples.
13|18|for those who have respond to their lord is the best [reward], but those who did not respond to him - if they had all that is in the earth entir and the like of it with it, they would [attempt to] ransom themselv thereby. those will have the worst account, and their refug is hell, and wretch is the rest place.
13|19|then is he who know that what ha been reveal to you from your lord is the truth like one who is blind? they will onli be remind who are peopl of understand -
13|20|those who fulfil the coven of allah and do not break the contract,
13|21|and those who join that which allah ha order to be join and fear their lord and are afraid of the evil of [their] account,
13|22|and those who are patient, seek the counten of their lord, and establish prayer and spend from what We have provid for them secretli and publicli and prevent evil with good - those will have the good consequ of [this] home -
13|23|garden of perpetu residence; they will enter them with whoever were righteou among their fathers, their spous and their descendants. and the angel will enter upon them from everi gate, [saying],
13|24|"peac be upon you for what you patient endured. and excel is the final home."
13|25|but those who break the coven of allah after contract it and sever that which allah ha order to be join and spread corrupt on earth - for them is the curse, and they will have the worst home.
13|26|allah extend provis for whom He will and restrict [it]. and they rejoic in the worldli life, while the worldli life is not, compar to the hereafter, except [brief] enjoyment.
13|27|and those who disbeliev say, "whi ha a sign not been sent down to him from hi lord?" say, [O muhammad], "indeed, allah leav astray whom He will and guid to himself whoever turn back [to him] -
13|28|those who have believ and whose heart are assur by the remembr of allah. unquestionably, by the remembr of allah heart are assured."
13|29|thos who have believ and done righteou deed - a good state is their and a good return.
13|30|thu have We sent you to a commun befor which [other] commun have pass on so you might recit to them that which We reveal to you, while they disbeliev in the most merciful. say, "he is my lord; there is no deiti except him. upon him I rely, and to him is my return."
13|31|and if there wa ani qur'an by which the mountain would be remov or the earth would be broken apart or the dead would be made to speak, [it would be thi qur'an], but to allah belong the affair entirely. then have those who believ not accept that had allah willed, He would have guid the people, all of them? and those who disbeliev do not ceas to be struck, for what they have done, by calam - or it will descend near their home - until there come the promis of allah. indeed, allah doe not fail in [his] promise.
13|32|and alreadi were [other] messeng ridicul befor you, and I extend the time of those who disbelieved; then I seiz them, and how [terrible] wa My penalty.
13|33|then is He who is a maintain of everi soul, [knowing] what it ha earned, [like ani other]? but to allah they have attribut partners. say, "name them. Or do you inform him of that which He know not upon the earth or of what is appar of speech?" rather, their [own] plan ha been made attract to those who disbelieve, and they have been avert from the way. and whomev allah leav astray - there will be for him no guide.
13|34|for them will be punish in the life of [this] world, and the punish of the hereaft is more severe. and they will not have from allah ani protector.
13|35|th exampl of paradise, which the righteou have been promised, is [that] beneath it river flow. it fruit is lasting, and it shade. that is the consequ for the righteous, and the consequ for the disbeliev is the fire.
13|36|and [the believ among] those to whom We have given the [previous] scriptur rejoic at what ha been reveal to you, [O muhammad], but among the [opposing] faction are those who deni part of it. say, "I have onli been command to worship allah and not associ [anything] with him. To him I invite, and to him is my return."
13|37|and thu We have reveal it as an arab legislation. and if you should follow their inclin after what ha come to you of knowledge, you would not have against allah ani alli or ani protector.
13|38|and We have alreadi sent messeng befor you and assign to them wive and descendants. and it wa not for a messeng to come with a sign except by permiss of allah. for everi term is a decree.
13|39|allah elimin what He will or confirms, and with him is the mother of the book.
13|40|and whether We show you part of what We promis them or take you in death, upon you is onli the [duti of] notification, and upon Us is the account.
13|41|hav they not seen that We set upon the land, reduc it from it borders? and allah decides; there is no adjust of hi decision. and He is swift in account.
13|42|and those befor them had plotted, but to allah belong the plan entirely. He know what everi soul earns, and the disbeliev will know for whom is the final home.
13|43|and those who have disbeliev say, "you are not a messenger." say, [O muhammad], "suffici is allah as wit between me and you, and [the wit of] whoever ha knowledg of the scripture."
14|1|alif, lam, ra. [thi is] a book which We have reveal to you, [O muhammad], that you might bring mankind out of dark into the light by permiss of their lord - to the path of the exalt in might, the praiseworthi -
14|2|allah, to whom belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth. and woe to the disbeliev from a sever punishment
14|3|th one who prefer the worldli life over the hereaft and avert [people] from the way of allah, seek to make it (seem) deviant. those are in extrem error.
14|4|and We did not send ani messeng except [speaking] in the languag of hi peopl to state clearli for them, and allah send astray [thereby] whom He will and guid whom He wills. and He is the exalt in might, the wise.
14|5|and We certainli sent mose with our signs, [saying], "bring out your peopl from dark into the light and remind them of the day of allah." inde in that are sign for everyon patient and grateful.
14|6|and [recall, O children of israel], when mose said to hi people, "rememb the favor of allah upon you when He save you from the peopl of pharaoh, who were afflict you with the worst torment and were slaughter your [newborn] son and keep your femal alive. and in that wa a great trial from your lord.
14|7|and [remember] when your lord proclaimed, 'if you are grateful, I will sure increas you [in favor]; but if you deny, indeed, My punish is severe.' "
14|8|and mose said, "if you should disbelieve, you and whoever is on the earth entir - indeed, allah is free of need and praiseworthy."
14|9|ha there not reach you the news of those befor you - the peopl of noah and 'aad and thamud and those after them? No one know them but allah. their messeng brought them clear proofs, but they return their hand to their mouth and said, "indeed, we disbeliev in that with which you have been sent, and inde we are, about that to which you invit us, in disquiet doubt."
14|10|their messeng said, "can there be doubt about allah, creator of the heaven and earth? He invit you that He may forgiv you of your sins, and He delay your death for a specifi term." they said, "you are not but men like us who wish to avert us from what our father were worshipping. So bring us a clear authority."
14|11|their messeng said to them, "we are onli men like you, but allah confer favor upon whom He will of hi servants. It ha never been for us to bring you evid except by permiss of allah. and upon allah let the believ rely.
14|12|and whi should we not reli upon allah while He ha guid us to our [good] ways. and we will sure be patient against whatev harm you should caus us. and upon allah let those who would reli [indeed] rely."
14|13|and those who disbeliev said to their messengers, "we will sure drive you out of our land, or you must return to our religion." So their lord inspir to them, "we will sure destroy the wrongdoers.
14|14|and We will sure caus you to dwell in the land after them. that is for he who fear My posit and fear My threat."
14|15|and they request victori from allah, and disappointed, [therefore], wa everi obstin tyrant.
14|16|befor him is hell, and he will be given a drink of purul water.
14|17|h will gulp it but will hardli [be abl to] swallow it. and death will come to him from everywhere, but he is not to die. and befor him is a massiv punishment.
14|18|th exampl of those who disbeliev in their lord is [that] their deed are like ash which the wind blow forc on a stormi day; they are unabl [to keep] from what they earn a [single] thing. that is what is extrem error.
14|19|hav you not seen that allah creat the heaven and the earth in truth? If He wills, He can do away with you and produc a new creation.
14|20|and that is not difficult for allah.
14|21|and they will come out [for judgement] befor allah all together, and the weak will say to those who were arrogant, "indeed, we were your followers, so can you avail us anyth against the punish of allah?" they will say, "if allah had guid us, we would have guid you. It is all the same for us whether we show intoler or are patient: there is for us no place of escape."
14|22|and satan will say when the matter ha been concluded, "indeed, allah had promis you the promis of truth. and I promis you, but I betray you. but I had no author over you except that I invit you, and you respond to me. So do not blame me; but blame yourselves. I cannot be call to your aid, nor can you be call to my aid. indeed, I deni your associ of me [with allah] before. indeed, for the wrongdoer is a pain punishment."
14|23|and those who believ and did righteou deed will be admit to garden beneath which river flow, abid etern therein by permiss of their lord; and their greet therein will be, "peace!"
14|24|hav you not consid how allah present an example, [making] a good word like a good tree, whose root is firmli fix and it branch [high] in the sky?
14|25|it produc it fruit all the time, by permiss of it lord. and allah present exampl for the peopl that perhap they will be reminded.
14|26|and the exampl of a bad word is like a bad tree, uproot from the surfac of the earth, not have ani stability.
14|27|allah keep firm those who believe, with the firm word, in worldli life and in the hereafter. and allah send astray the wrongdoers. and allah doe what He wills.
14|28|hav you not consid those who exchang the favor of allah for disbelief and settl their peopl [in] the home of ruin?
14|29|[it is] hell, which they will [enter to] burn, and wretch is the settlement.
14|30|and they have attribut to allah equal to mislead [people] from hi way. say, "enjoy yourselves, for indeed, your destin is the fire."
14|31|[o muhammad], tell My servant who have believ to establish prayer and spend from what We have provid them, secretli and publicly, befor a day come in which there will be no exchange, nor ani friendships.
14|32|it is allah who creat the heaven and the earth and sent down rain from the sky and produc therebi some fruit as provis for you and subject for you the ship to sail through the sea by hi command and subject for you the rivers.
14|33|and He subject for you the sun and the moon, continu [in orbit], and subject for you the night and the day.
14|34|and He gave you from all you ask of him. and if you should count the favor of allah, you could not enumer them. indeed, mankind is [generally] most unjust and ungrateful.
14|35|and [mention, O muhammad], when abraham said, "mi lord, make thi citi [makkah] secur and keep me and my son away from worship idols.
14|36|mi lord, inde they have led astray mani among the people. So whoever follow me - then he is of me; and whoever disobey me - indeed, you are [yet] forgiv and merciful.
14|37|our lord, I have settl some of my descend in an uncultiv valley near your sacr house, our lord, that they may establish prayer. So make heart among the peopl inclin toward them and provid for them from the fruit that they might be grateful.
14|38|our lord, inde you know what we conceal and what we declare, and noth is hidden from allah on the earth or in the heaven.
14|39|prais to allah, who ha grant to me in old age ishmael and isaac. indeed, my lord is the hearer of supplication.
14|40|mi lord, make me an establish of prayer, and [many] from my descendants. our lord, and accept my supplication.
14|41|our lord, forgiv me and my parent and the believ the day the account is established."
14|42|and never think that allah is unawar of what the wrongdoer do. He onli delay them for a day when eye will stare [in horror].
14|43|rac ahead, their head rais up, their glanc doe not come back to them, and their heart are void.
14|44|and, [O muhammad], warn the peopl of a day when the punish will come to them and those who did wrong will say, "our lord, delay us for a short term; we will answer your call and follow the messengers." [but it will be said], "had you not sworn, before, that for you there would be no cessation?
14|45|and you live among the dwell of those who wrong themselves, and it had becom clear to you how We dealt with them. and We present for you [many] examples."
14|46|and they had plan their plan, but with allah is [recorded] their plan, even if their plan had been [sufficient] to do away with the mountains.
14|47|so never think that allah will fail in hi promis to hi messengers. indeed, allah is exalt in might and owner of retribution.
14|48|[it will be] on the day the earth will be replac by anoth earth, and the heaven [a well], and all creatur will come out befor allah, the one, the prevailing.
14|49|and you will see the crimin that day bound togeth in shackles,
14|50|their garment of liquid pitch and their face cover by the fire.
14|51|so that allah will recompens everi soul for what it earned. indeed, allah is swift in account.
14|52|thi [qur'an] is notif for the peopl that they may be warn therebi and that they may know that He is but one god and that those of understand will be reminded.
15|1|alif, lam, ra. these are the vers of the book and a clear qur'an.
15|2|perhap those who disbeliev will wish that they had been muslims.
15|3|let them eat and enjoy themselv and be divert by [false] hope, for they are go to know.
15|4|and We did not destroy ani citi but that for it wa a known decree.
15|5|no nation will preced it term, nor will they remain thereafter.
15|6|and they say, "O you upon whom the messag ha been sent down, inde you are mad.
15|7|whi do you not bring us the angels, if you should be among the truthful?"
15|8|w do not send down the angel except with truth; and the disbeliev would not then be reprieved.
15|9|indeed, it is We who sent down the qur'an and indeed, We will be it guardian.
15|10|and We had certainli sent [messengers] befor you, [O muhammad], among the sect of the former peoples.
15|11|and no messeng would come to them except that they ridicul him.
15|12|thu do We insert denial into the heart of the criminals.
15|13|they will not believ in it, while there ha alreadi occur the preced of the former peoples.
15|14|and [even] if We open to them a gate from the heaven and they continu therein to ascend,
15|15|they would say, "our eye have onli been dazzled. rather, we are a peopl affect by magic."
15|16|and We have place within the heaven great star and have beautifi it for the observers.
15|17|and We have protect it from everi devil expel [from the merci of allah]
15|18|except one who steal a hear and is pursu by a clear burn flame.
15|19|and the earth - We have spread it and cast therein firmli set mountain and caus to grow therein [something] of everi well-balanc thing.
15|20|and We have made for you therein mean of live and [for] those for whom you are not providers.
15|21|and there is not a thing but that with Us are it depositories, and We do not send it down except accord to a known measure.
15|22|and We have sent the fertil wind and sent down water from the sky and given you drink from it. and you are not it retainers.
15|23|and indeed, it is We who give life and caus death, and We are the inheritor.
15|24|and We have alreadi known the preced [generations] among you, and We have alreadi known the later [one to come].
15|25|and indeed, your lord will gather them; indeed, He is wise and knowing.
15|26|and We did certainli creat man out of clay from an alter black mud.
15|27|and the jinn We creat befor from scorch fire.
15|28|and [mention, O muhammad], when your lord said to the angels, "I will creat a human be out of clay from an alter black mud.
15|29|and when I have proport him and breath into him of My [created] soul, then fall down to him in prostration."
15|30|so the angel prostrat - all of them entirely,
15|31|except iblees, he refus to be with those who prostrated.
15|32|[allah] said, O iblees, what is [the matter] with you that you are not with those who prostrate?"
15|33|h said, "never would I prostrat to a human whom you creat out of clay from an alter black mud."
15|34|[allah] said, "then get out of it, for indeed, you are expelled.
15|35|and indeed, upon you is the curs until the day of recompense."
15|36|h said, "mi lord, then repriev me until the day they are resurrected."
15|37|[allah] said, "so indeed, you are of those reprieved
15|38|until the day of the time well-known."
15|39|[iblees] said, "mi lord, becaus you have put me in error, I will sure make [disobedience] attract to them on earth, and I will mislead them all
15|40|except, among them, your chosen servants."
15|41|[allah] said, "thi is a path [of return] to Me [that is] straight.
15|42|indeed, My servant - no author will you have over them, except those who follow you of the deviators.
15|43|and indeed, hell is the promis place for them all.
15|44|it ha seven gates; for everi gate is of them a portion designated."
15|45|indeed, the righteou will be within garden and springs.
15|46|[hav been told], "enter it in peace, safe [and secure]."
15|47|and We will remov whatev is in their breast of resentment, [so they will be] brothers, on throne face each other.
15|48|no fatigu will touch them therein, nor from it will they [ever] be removed.
15|49|[o muhammad], inform My servant that it is I who am the forgiving, the merciful.
15|50|and that it is My punish which is the pain punishment.
15|51|and inform them about the guest of abraham,
15|52|when they enter upon him and said, "peace." [abraham] said, "indeed, we are fear of you."
15|53|[th angels] said, "fear not. indeed, we give you good tide of a learn boy."
15|54|h said, "have you given me good tide although old age ha come upon me? then of what [wonder] do you inform?"
15|55|they said, "we have given you good tide in truth, so do not be of the despairing."
15|56|h said, "and who despair of the merci of hi lord except for those astray?"
15|57|[abraham] said, "then what is your busi [here], O messengers?"
15|58|they said, "indeed, we have been sent to a peopl of criminals,
15|59|except the famili of lot; indeed, we will save them all
15|60|except hi wife." allah decre that she is of those who remain behind.
15|61|and when the messeng came to the famili of lot,
15|62|h said, "indeed, you are peopl unknown."
15|63|they said, "but we have come to you with that about which they were disputing,
15|64|and we have come to you with truth, and indeed, we are truthful.
15|65|so set out with your famili dure a portion of the night and follow behind them and let not anyon among you look back and continu on to where you are commanded."
15|66|and We convey to him [the decree] of that matter: that those [sinners] would be elimin by earli morning.
15|67|and the peopl of the citi came rejoicing.
15|68|[lot] said, "indeed, these are my guests, so do not shame me.
15|69|and fear allah and do not disgrac me."
15|70|they said, "have we not forbidden you from [protecting] people?"
15|71|[lot] said, "these are my daughter - if you would be doer [of law marriage]."
15|72|bi your life, [O muhammad], inde they were, in their intoxication, wander blindly.
15|73|so the shriek seiz them at sunrise.
15|74|and We made the highest part [of the city] it lowest and rain upon them stone of hard clay.
15|75|inde in that are sign for those who discern.
15|76|and indeed, those citi are [situated] on an establish road.
15|77|inde in that is a sign for the believers.
15|78|and the companion of the thicket were [also] wrongdoers.
15|79|so We took retribut from them, and indeed, both [cities] are on a clear highway.
15|80|and certainli did the companion of thamud deni the messengers.
15|81|and We gave them our signs, but from them they were turn away.
15|82|and they use to carv from the mountains, houses, feel secure.
15|83|but the shriek seiz them at earli morning.
15|84|so noth avail them [from] what they use to earn.
15|85|and We have not creat the heaven and earth and that between them except in truth. and indeed, the hour is coming; so forgiv with graciou forgiveness.
15|86|indeed, your lord - He is the know creator.
15|87|and We have certainli given you, [O muhammad], seven of the often repeat [verses] and the great qur'an.
15|88|do not extend your eye toward that by which We have given enjoy to [certain] categori of the disbelievers, and do not griev over them. and lower your wing to the believers
15|89|and say, "indeed, I am the clear warner" -
15|90|just as We had reveal [scriptures] to the separators
15|91|who have made the qur'an into portions.
15|92|so by your lord, We will sure question them all
15|93|about what they use to do.
15|94|then declar what you are command and turn away from the polytheists.
15|95|indeed, We are suffici for you against the mockers
15|96|who make [equal] with allah anoth deity. but they are go to know.
15|97|and We alreadi know that your breast is constrain by what they say.
15|98|so exalt [allah] with prais of your lord and be of those who prostrat [to him].
15|99|and worship your lord until there come to you the certainti (death).
16|1|th command of allah is coming, so be not impati for it. exalt is He and high abov what they associ with him.
16|2|h send down the angels, with the inspir of hi command, upon whom He will of hi servants, [tell them], "warn that there is no deiti except me; so fear me."
16|3|h creat the heaven and earth in truth. high is He abov what they associ with him.
16|4|h creat man from a sperm-drop; then at once, he is a clear adversary.
16|5|and the graze livestock He ha creat for you; in them is warmth and [numerous] benefits, and from them you eat.
16|6|and for you in them is [the enjoy of] beauti when you bring them in [for the evening] and when you send them out [to pasture].
16|7|and they carri your load to a land you could not have reach except with difficulti to yourselves. indeed, your lord is kind and merciful.
16|8|and [he created] the horses, mule and donkey for you to ride and [as] adornment. and He creat that which you do not know.
16|9|and upon allah is the direct of the [right] way, and among the variou path are those deviating. and if He willed, He could have guid you all.
16|10|it is He who send down rain from the sky; from it is drink and from it is foliag in which you pastur [animals].
16|11|h caus to grow for you therebi the crops, olives, palm trees, grapevines, and from all the fruits. inde in that is a sign for a peopl who give thought.
16|12|and He ha subject for you the night and day and the sun and moon, and the star are subject by hi command. inde in that are sign for a peopl who reason.
16|13|and [he ha subjected] whatev He multipli for you on the earth of vari colors. inde in that is a sign for a peopl who remember.
16|14|and it is He who subject the sea for you to eat from it tender meat and to extract from it ornament which you wear. and you see the ship plow through it, and [he subject it] that you may seek of hi bounty; and perhap you will be grateful.
16|15|and He ha cast into the earth firmli set mountains, lest it shift with you, and [made] river and roads, that you may be guided,
16|16|and landmarks. and by the star they are [also] guided.
16|17|then is He who creat like one who doe not create? So will you not be reminded?
16|18|and if you should count the favor of allah, you could not enumer them. indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
16|19|and allah know what you conceal and what you declare.
16|20|and those they invok other than allah creat nothing, and they [themselves] are created.
16|21|they are, [in fact], dead, not alive, and they do not perceiv when they will be resurrected.
16|22|your god is one god. but those who do not believ in the hereaft - their heart are disapproving, and they are arrogant.
16|23|assuredly, allah know what they conceal and what they declare. indeed, He doe not like the arrogant.
16|24|and when it is said to them, "what ha your lord sent down?" they say, "legend of the former peoples,"
16|25|that they may bear their own burden in full on the day of resurrect and some of the burden of those whom they misguid without knowledge. unquestionably, evil is that which they bear.
16|26|thos befor them had alreadi plotted, but allah came at their build from the foundations, so the roof fell upon them from abov them, and the punish came to them from where they did not perceive.
16|27|then on the day of resurrect He will disgrac them and say, "where are My 'partners' for whom you use to oppos [the believers]?" those who were given knowledg will say, "inde disgrace, thi day, and evil are upon the disbelievers" -
16|28|the one whom the angel take in death [while] wrong themselves, and [who] then offer submission, [saying], "we were not do ani evil." but, yes! indeed, allah is know of what you use to do.
16|29|so enter the gate of hell to abid etern therein, and how wretch is the resid of the arrogant.
16|30|and it will be said to those who fear allah, "what did your lord send down?" they will say, "[that which is] good." for those who do good in thi world is good; and the home of the hereaft is better. and how excel is the home of the righteou -
16|31|garden of perpetu residence, which they will enter, beneath which river flow. they will have therein whatev they wish. thu doe allah reward the righteou -
16|32|the one whom the angel take in death, [being] good and pure; [the angels] will say, "peac be upon you. enter paradis for what you use to do."
16|33|do the disbeliev await [anything] except that the angel should come to them or there come the command of your lord? thu did those do befor them. and allah wrong them not, but they had been wrong themselves.
16|34|so they were struck by the evil consequ of what they did and were envelop by what they use to ridicule.
16|35|and those who associ other with allah say, "if allah had willed, we would not have worship anyth other than him, neither we nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anyth through other than him." thu did those do befor them. So is there upon the messeng except [the duti of] clear notification?
16|36|and We certainli sent into everi nation a messenger, [saying], "worship allah and avoid taghut." and among them were those whom allah guided, and among them were those upon whom error wa [deservedly] decreed. So proceed through the earth and observ how wa the end of the deniers.
16|37|[even] if you should strive for their guidance, [O muhammad], indeed, allah doe not guid those He send astray, and they will have no helpers.
16|38|and they swear by allah their strongest oath [that] allah will not resurrect one who dies. but ye - [it is] a true promis [binding] upon him, but most of the peopl do not know.
16|39|[it is] so He will make clear to them [the truth of] that wherein they differ and so those who have disbeliev may know that they were liars.
16|40|indeed, our word to a thing when We intend it is but that We say to it, "be," and it is.
16|41|and those who emigr for [the caus of] allah after they had been wrong - We will sure settl them in thi world in a good place; but the reward of the hereaft is greater, if onli they could know.
16|42|[they are] those who endur patient and upon their lord relied.
16|43|and We sent not befor you except men to whom We reveal [our message]. So ask the peopl of the messag if you do not know.
16|44|[w sent them] with clear proof and written ordinances. and We reveal to you the messag that you may make clear to the peopl what wa sent down to them and that they might give thought.
16|45|then, do those who have plan evil deed feel secur that allah will not caus the earth to swallow them or that the punish will not come upon them from where they do not perceive?
16|46|or that He would not seiz them dure their [usual] activity, and they could not caus failure?
16|47|or that He would not seiz them gradual [in a state of dread]? but indeed, your lord is kind and merciful.
16|48|hav they not consid what thing allah ha created? their shadow inclin to the right and to the left, prostrat to allah, while they are humble.
16|49|and to allah prostrat whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth of creatures, and the angel [a well], and they are not arrogant.
16|50|they fear their lord abov them, and they do what they are commanded.
16|51|and allah ha said, "do not take for yourselv two deities. He is but one god, so fear onli me."
16|52|and to him belong whatev is in the heaven and the earth, and to him is [due] worship constantly. then is it other than allah that you fear?
16|53|and whatev you have of favor - it is from allah. then when advers touch you, to him you cri for help.
16|54|then when He remov the advers from you, at onc a parti of you associ other with their lord
16|55|so they will deni what We have given them. then enjoy yourselves, for you are go to know.
16|56|and they assign to what they do not know a portion of that which We have provid them. By allah, you will sure be question about what you use to invent.
16|57|and they attribut to allah daughter - exalt is He - and for them is what they desire.
16|58|and when one of them is inform of [the birth of] a female, hi face becom dark, and he suppress grief.
16|59|h hide himself from the peopl becaus of the ill of which he ha been informed. should he keep it in humili or buri it in the ground? unquestionably, evil is what they decide.
16|60|for those who do not believ in the hereaft is the descript of evil; and for allah is the highest attribute. and He is exalt in might, the wise.
16|61|and if allah were to impos blame on the peopl for their wrongdoing, He would not have left upon the earth ani creature, but He defer them for a specifi term. and when their term ha come, they will not remain behind an hour, nor will they preced [it].
16|62|and they attribut to allah that which they dislike, and their tongu assert the lie that they will have the best [from him]. assuredly, they will have the fire, and they will be [therein] neglected.
16|63|bi allah, We did certainli send [messengers] to nation befor you, but satan made their deed attract to them. and he is the disbelievers' alli today [a well], and they will have a pain punishment.
16|64|and We have not reveal to you the book, [O muhammad], except for you to make clear to them that wherein they have differ and as guidanc and merci for a peopl who believe.
16|65|and allah ha sent down rain from the sky and given life therebi to the earth after it lifelessness. inde in that is a sign for a peopl who listen.
16|66|and indeed, for you in graze livestock is a lesson. We give you drink from what is in their belli - between excret and blood - pure milk, palat to drinkers.
16|67|and from the fruit of the palm tree and grapevin you take intoxic and good provision. inde in that is a sign for a peopl who reason.
16|68|and your lord inspir to the bee, "take for yourself among the mountains, houses, and among the tree and [in] that which they construct.
16|69|then eat from all the fruit and follow the way of your lord laid down [for you]." there emerg from their belli a drink, vari in colors, in which there is heal for people. inde in that is a sign for a peopl who give thought.
16|70|and allah creat you; then He will take you in death. and among you is he who is revers to the most decrepit [old] age so that he will not know, after [have had] knowledge, a thing. indeed, allah is know and competent.
16|71|and allah ha favor some of you over other in provision. but those who were favor would not hand over their provis to those whom their right hand possess so they would be equal to them therein. then is it the favor of allah they reject?
16|72|and allah ha made for you from yourselv mate and ha made for you from your mate son and grandchildren and ha provid for you from the good things. then in falsehood do they believ and in the favor of allah they disbelieve?
16|73|and they worship besid allah that which doe not possess for them [the power of] provis from the heaven and the earth at all, and [in fact], they are unable.
16|74|so do not assert similar to allah. indeed, allah know and you do not know.
16|75|allah present an example: a slave [who is] own and unabl to do a thing and he to whom We have provid from Us good provision, so he spend from it secretli and publicly. can they be equal? prais to allah! but most of them do not know.
16|76|and allah present an exampl of two men, one of them dumb and unabl to do a thing, while he is a burden to hi guardian. wherev he direct him, he bring no good. Is he equal to one who command justice, while he is on a straight path?
16|77|and to allah belong the unseen [aspects] of the heaven and the earth. and the command for the hour is not but as a glanc of the eye or even nearer. indeed, allah is over all thing competent.
16|78|and allah ha extract you from the womb of your mother not know a thing, and He made for you hear and vision and intellect that perhap you would be grateful.
16|79|do they not see the bird control in the atmospher of the sky? none hold them up except allah. inde in that are sign for a peopl who believe.
16|80|and allah ha made for you from your home a place of rest and made for you from the hide of the anim tent which you find light on your day of travel and your day of encampment; and from their wool, fur and hair is furnish and enjoy for a time.
16|81|and allah ha made for you, from that which He ha created, shadow and ha made for you from the mountains, shelter and ha made for you garment which protect you from the heat and garment which protect you from your [enemi in] battle. thu doe He complet hi favor upon you that you might submit [to him].
16|82|but if they turn away, [O muhammad] - then onli upon you is [respons for] clear notification.
16|83|they recogn the favor of allah; then they deni it. and most of them are disbelievers.
16|84|and [mention] the day when We will resurrect from everi nation a witness. then it will not be permit to the disbeliev [to apolog or make excuses], nor will they be ask to appeas [allah].
16|85|and when those who wrong see the punishment, it will not be lighten for them, nor will they be reprieved.
16|86|and when those who associ other with allah see their "partners," they will say," our lord, these are our partner [to you] whom we use to invok besid you." but they will throw at them the statement, "indeed, you are liars."
16|87|and they will impart to allah that day [their] submission, and lost from them is what they use to invent.
16|88|thos who disbeliev and avert [others] from the way of allah - We will increas them in punish over [their] punish for what corrupt they were causing.
16|89|and [mention] the day when We will resurrect among everi nation a wit over them from themselves. and We will bring you, [O muhammad], as a wit over your nation. and We have sent down to you the book as clarif for all thing and as guidanc and merci and good tide for the muslims.
16|90|indeed, allah order justic and good conduct and give to rel and forbid immor and bad conduct and oppression. He admonish you that perhap you will be reminded.
16|91|and fulfil the coven of allah when you have taken it, [O believers], and do not break oath after their confirm while you have made allah, over you, a witness. indeed, allah know what you do.
16|92|and do not be like she who untwist her spun thread after it wa strong [by] take your oath as [mean of] deceit between you becaus one commun is more plenti [in number or wealth] than anoth community. allah onli tri you thereby. and He will sure make clear to you on the day of resurrect that over which you use to differ.
16|93|and if allah had willed, He could have made you [of] one religion, but He caus to stray whom He will and guid whom He wills. and you will sure be question about what you use to do.
16|94|and do not take your oath as [mean of] deceit between you, lest a foot slip after it wa [once] firm, and you would tast evil [in thi world] for what [people] you divert from the way of allah, and you would have [in the hereafter] a great punishment.
16|95|and do not exchang the coven of allah for a small price. indeed, what is with allah is best for you, if onli you could know.
16|96|whatev you have will end, but what allah ha is lasting. and We will sure give those who were patient their reward accord to the best of what they use to do.
16|97|whoev doe righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believ - We will sure caus him to live a good life, and We will sure give them their reward [in the hereafter] accord to the best of what they use to do.
16|98|so when you recit the qur'an, [first] seek refug in allah from satan, the expel [from hi mercy].
16|99|indeed, there is for him no author over those who have believ and reli upon their lord.
16|100|hi author is onli over those who take him as an alli and those who through him associ other with allah.
16|101|and when We substitut a vers in place of a vers - and allah is most know of what He send down - they say, "you, [O muhammad], are but an inventor [of lies]." but most of them do not know.
16|102|say, [O muhammad], "the pure spirit ha brought it down from your lord in truth to make firm those who believ and as guidanc and good tide to the muslims."
16|103|and We certainli know that they say, "it is onli a human be who teach the prophet." the tongu of the one they refer to is foreign, and thi qur'an is [in] a clear arab language.
16|104|indeed, those who do not believ in the vers of allah - allah will not guid them, and for them is a pain punishment.
16|105|they onli invent falsehood who do not believ in the vers of allah, and it is those who are the liars.
16|106|whoev disbeliev in allah after hi belief... except for one who is forc [to renounc hi religion] while hi heart is secur in faith. but those who [willingly] open their breast to disbelief, upon them is wrath from allah, and for them is a great punishment;
16|107|that is becaus they prefer the worldli life over the hereaft and that allah doe not guid the disbeliev people.
16|108|thos are the one over whose heart and hear and vision allah ha sealed, and it is those who are the heedless.
16|109|assuredly, it is they, in the hereafter, who will be the losers.
16|110|then, inde your lord, to those who emigr after they had been compel [to renounc their religion] and thereaft fought [for the caus of allah] and were patient - indeed, your lord, after that, is forgiv and merciful
16|111|on the day when everi soul will come disput for itself, and everi soul will be fulli compens for what it did, and they will not be wronged.
16|112|and allah present an example: a citi which wa safe and secure, it provis come to it in abund from everi location, but it deni the favor of allah. So allah made it tast the envelop of hunger and fear for what they had been doing.
16|113|and there had certainli come to them a messeng from among themselves, but they deni him; so punish overtook them while they were wrongdoers.
16|114|then eat of what allah ha provid for you [which is] law and good. and be grate for the favor of allah, if it is [indeed] him that you worship.
16|115|h ha onli forbidden to you dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which ha been dedic to other than allah. but whoever is forc [bi necessity], neither desir [it] nor transgress [it limit] - then indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
16|116|and do not say about what your tongu assert of untruth, "thi is law and thi is unlawful," to invent falsehood about allah. indeed, those who invent falsehood about allah will not succeed.
16|117|[it is but] a brief enjoyment, and they will have a pain punishment.
16|118|and to those who are jew We have prohibit that which We relat to you before. and We did not wrong them [thereby], but they were wrong themselves.
16|119|then, inde your lord, to those who have done wrong out of ignor and then repent after that and correct themselv - indeed, your lord, thereafter, is forgiv and merciful.
16|120|indeed, abraham wa a [comprehensive] leader, devoutli obedi to allah, inclin toward truth, and he wa not of those who associ other with allah.
16|121|[h was] grate for hi favors. allah chose him and guid him to a straight path.
16|122|and We gave him good in thi world, and indeed, in the hereaft he will be among the righteous.
16|123|then We reveal to you, [O muhammad], to follow the religion of abraham, inclin toward truth; and he wa not of those who associ with allah.
16|124|th sabbath wa onli appoint for those who differ over it. and indeed, your lord will judg between them on the day of resurrect concern that over which they use to differ.
16|125|invit to the way of your lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argu with them in a way that is best. indeed, your lord is most know of who ha stray from hi way, and He is most know of who is [rightly] guided.
16|126|and if you punish [an enemy, O believers], punish with an equival of that with which you were harmed. but if you are patient - it is better for those who are patient.
16|127|and be patient, [O muhammad], and your patienc is not but through allah. and do not griev over them and do not be in distress over what they conspire.
16|128|indeed, allah is with those who fear him and those who are doer of good.
17|1|exalt is He who took hi servant by night from al-masjid al-haram to al-masjid al-aqsa, whose surround We have blessed, to show him of our signs. indeed, He is the hearing, the seeing.
17|2|and We gave mose the scriptur and made it a guidanc for the children of israel that you not take other than Me as dispos of affairs,
17|3|o descend of those We carri [in the ship] with noah. indeed, he wa a grate servant.
17|4|and We convey to the children of israel in the scriptur that, "you will sure caus corrupt on the earth twice, and you will sure reach [a degre of] great haughtiness.
17|5|so when the [time of] promis came for the first of them, We sent against you servant of our - those of great militari might, and they probe [even] into the homes, and it wa a promis fulfilled.
17|6|then We gave back to you a return victori over them. and We reinforc you with wealth and son and made you more numer in manpower
17|7|[and said], "if you do good, you do good for yourselves; and if you do evil, [you do it] to yourselves." then when the final promis came, [we sent your enemies] to sadden your face and to enter the templ in jerusalem, as they enter it the first time, and to destroy what they had taken over with [total] destruction.
17|8|[then allah said], "it is expected, [if you repent], that your lord will have merci upon you. but if you return [to sin], We will return [to punishment]. and We have made hell, for the disbelievers, a prison-bed."
17|9|indeed, thi qur'an guid to that which is most suitabl and give good tide to the believ who do righteou deed that they will have a great reward.
17|10|and that those who do not believ in the hereaft - We have prepar for them a pain punishment.
17|11|and man supplic for evil as he supplic for good, and man is ever hasty.
17|12|and We have made the night and day two signs, and We eras the sign of the night and made the sign of the day visibl that you may seek bounti from your lord and may know the number of year and the account [of time]. and everyth We have set out in detail.
17|13|and [for] everi person We have impos hi fate upon hi neck, and We will produc for him on the day of resurrect a record which he will encount spread open.
17|14|[it will be said], "read your record. suffici is yourself against you thi day as accountant."
17|15|whoev is guid is onli guid for [the benefit of] hi soul. and whoever err onli err against it. and no bearer of burden will bear the burden of another. and never would We punish until We sent a messenger.
17|16|and when We intend to destroy a city, We command it affluent but they defiantli disobey therein; so the word come into effect upon it, and We destroy it with [complete] destruction.
17|17|and how mani have We destroy from the gener after noah. and suffici is your lord, concern the sin of hi servants, as acquaint and seeing.
17|18|whoev should desir the immedi - We hasten for him from it what We will to whom We intend. then We have made for him hell, which he will [enter to] burn, censur and banished.
17|19|but whoever desir the hereaft and exert the effort due to it while he is a believ - it is those whose effort is ever appreci [bi allah].
17|20|to each [category] We extend - to these and to those - from the gift of your lord. and never ha the gift of your lord been restricted.
17|21|look how We have favor [in provision] some of them over others. but the hereaft is greater in degre [of difference] and greater in distinction.
17|22|do not make [a equal] with allah anoth deiti and [thereby] becom censur and forsaken.
17|23|and your lord ha decre that you not worship except him, and to parents, good treatment. whether one or both of them reach old age [while] with you, say not to them [so much as], "uff," and do not repel them but speak to them a nobl word.
17|24|and lower to them the wing of humil out of merci and say, "mi lord, have merci upon them as they brought me up [when I was] small."
17|25|your lord is most know of what is within yourselves. If you should be righteou [in intention] - then inde He is ever, to the often return [to him], forgiving.
17|26|and give the rel hi right, and [also] the poor and the traveler, and do not spend wastefully.

17|31|and do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provid for them and for you. indeed, their kill is ever a great sin.
17|32|and do not approach unlaw sexual intercourse. indeed, it is ever an immor and is evil as a way.
17|33|and do not kill the soul which allah ha forbidden, except by right. and whoever is kill unjustli - We have given hi heir authority, but let him not exceed limit in [the matter of] take life. indeed, he ha been support [bi the law].
17|34|and do not approach the properti of an orphan, except in the way that is best, until he reach maturity. and fulfil [every] commitment. indeed, the commit is ever [that about which one will be] questioned.
17|35|and give full measur when you measure, and weigh with an even balance. that is the best [way] and best in result.
17|36|and do not pursu that of which you have no knowledge. indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - about all those [one] will be questioned.
17|37|and do not walk upon the earth exultantly. indeed, you will never tear the earth [apart], and you will never reach the mountain in height.
17|38|al that - it evil is ever, in the sight of your lord, detested.
17|39|that is from what your lord ha reveal to you, [O muhammad], of wisdom. and, [O mankind], do not make [a equal] with allah anoth deity, lest you be thrown into hell, blame and banished.
17|40|then, ha your lord chosen you for [having] son and taken from among the angel daughters? indeed, you say a grave saying.
17|41|and We have certainli diversifi [the contents] in thi qur'an that mankind may be reminded, but it doe not increas the disbeliev except in aversion.
17|42|say, [O muhammad], "if there had been with him [other] gods, as they say, then they [each] would have sought to the owner of the throne a way."
17|43|exalt is He and high abov what they say by great sublimity.
17|44|th seven heaven and the earth and whatev is in them exalt him. and there is not a thing except that it exalt [allah] by hi praise, but you do not understand their [way of] exalting. indeed, He is ever forbear and forgiving.

17|47|w are most know of how they listen to it when they listen to you and [of] when they are in privat conversation, when the wrongdoer say, "you follow not but a man affect by magic."
17|48|look how they strike for you comparisons; but they have strayed, so they cannot [find] a way.
17|49|and they say, "when we are bone and crumbl particles, will we [truly] be resurrect as a new creation?"
17|50|say, "be you stone or iron
17|51|or [any] creation of that which is great within your breasts." and they will say, "who will restor us?" say, "he who brought you forth the first time." then they will nod their head toward you and say, "when is that?" say, "perhap it will be soon -
17|52|on the day He will call you and you will respond with prais of him and think that you had not remain [in the world] except for a little."
17|53|and tell My servant to say that which is best. indeed, satan induc [dissension] among them. inde satan is ever, to mankind, a clear enemy.

17|56|say, "invok those you have claim [a gods] besid him, for they do not possess the [abil for] remov of advers from you or [for its] transfer [to someon else]."
17|57|thos whom they invok seek mean of access to their lord, [strive as to] which of them would be nearest, and they hope for hi merci and fear hi punishment. indeed, the punish of your lord is ever feared.
17|58|and there is no citi but that We will destroy it befor the day of resurrect or punish it with a sever punishment. that ha ever been in the regist inscribed.
17|59|and noth ha prevent Us from send sign except that the former peopl deni them. and We gave thamud the she-camel as a visibl sign, but they wrong her. and We send not the sign except as a warning.
17|60|and [remember, O muhammad], when We told you, "indeed, your lord ha encompass the people." and We did not make the sight which We show you except as a trial for the people, as wa the accurs tree [mentioned] in the qur'an. and We threaten them, but it increas them not except in great transgression.
17|61|and [mention] when We said to the angles, "prostrat to adam," and they prostrated, except for iblees. He said, "should I prostrat to one you creat from clay?"
17|62|[iblees] said, "do you see thi one whom you have honor abov me? If you delay me until the day of resurrection, I will sure destroy hi descendants, except for a few."
17|63|[allah] said, "go, for whoever of them follow you, inde hell will be the recompens of you - an ampl recompense.
17|64|and incit [to senselessness] whoever you can among them with your voic and assault them with your hors and foot soldier and becom a partner in their wealth and their children and promis them." but satan doe not promis them except delusion.
17|65|indeed, over My [believing] servant there is for you no authority. and suffici is your lord as dispos of affairs.
17|66|it is your lord who drive the ship for you through the sea that you may seek of hi bounty. indeed, He is ever, to you, merciful.
17|67|and when advers touch you at sea, lost are [all] those you invok except for him. but when He deliv you to the land, you turn away [from him]. and ever is man ungrateful.
17|68|then do you feel secur that [instead] He will not caus a part of the land to swallow you or send against you a storm of stones? then you would not find for yourselv an advocate.
17|69|or do you feel secur that He will not send you back into the sea anoth time and send upon you a hurrican of wind and drown you for what you denied? then you would not find for yourselv against Us an avenger.
17|70|and We have certainli honor the children of adam and carri them on the land and sea and provid for them of the good thing and prefer them over much of what We have created, with [definite] preference.
17|71|[mention, O muhammad], the day We will call forth everi peopl with their record [of deeds]. then whoever is given hi record in hi right hand - those will read their records, and injustic will not be done to them, [even] as much as a thread [insid the date seed].
17|72|and whoever is blind in thi [life] will be blind in the hereaft and more astray in way.
17|73|and indeed, they were about to tempt you away from that which We reveal to you in order to [make] you invent about Us someth else; and then they would have taken you as a friend.
17|74|and if We had not strengthen you, you would have almost inclin to them a little.
17|75|then [if you had], We would have made you tast doubl [punish in] life and doubl [after] death. then you would not find for yourself against Us a helper.
17|76|and indeed, they were about to drive you from the land to evict you therefrom. and then [when they do], they will not remain [there] after you, except for a little.
17|77|[that is our] establish way for those We had sent befor you of our messengers; and you will not find in our way ani alteration.
17|78|establish prayer at the declin of the sun [from it meridian] until the dark of the night and [also] the qur'an of dawn. indeed, the recit of dawn is ever witnessed.
17|79|and from [part of] the night, pray with it as addit [worship] for you; it is expect that your lord will resurrect you to a prais station.
17|80|and say, "mi lord, caus me to enter a sound entranc and to exit a sound exit and grant me from yourself a support authority."
17|81|and say, "truth ha come, and falsehood ha departed. inde is falsehood, [bi nature], ever bound to depart."
17|82|and We send down of the qur'an that which is heal and merci for the believers, but it doe not increas the wrongdoer except in loss.
17|83|and when We bestow favor upon the disbeliever, he turn away and distanc himself; and when evil touch him, he is ever despairing.
17|84|say, "each work accord to hi manner, but your lord is most know of who is best guid in way."
17|85|and they ask you, [O muhammad], about the soul. say, "the soul is of the affair of my lord. and mankind have not been given of knowledg except a little."
17|86|and if We willed, We could sure do away with that which We reveal to you. then you would not find for yourself concern it an advoc against us.
17|87|except [we have left it with you] as a merci from your lord. indeed, hi favor upon you ha ever been great.
17|88|say, "if mankind and the jinn gather in order to produc the like of thi qur'an, they could not produc the like of it, even if they were to each other assistants."
17|89|and We have certainli diversifi for the peopl in thi qur'an from everi [kind] of example, but most of the peopl refus [anything] except disbelief.
17|90|and they say, "we will not believ you until you break open for us from the ground a spring.
17|91|or [until] you have a garden of palm tress and grape and make river gush forth within them in forc [and abundance]
17|92|or you make the heaven fall upon us in fragment as you have claim or you bring allah and the angel befor [us]
17|93|or you have a hous of gold or you ascend into the sky. and [even then], we will not believ in your ascens until you bring down to us a book we may read." say, "exalt is my lord! wa I ever but a human messenger?"
17|94|and what prevent the peopl from believ when guidanc came to them except that they said, "ha allah sent a human messenger?"
17|95|say, "if there were upon the earth angel walk securely, We would have sent down to them from the heaven an angel [a a] messenger."
17|96|say, "suffici is allah as wit between me and you. inde he is ever, concern hi servants, acquaint and seeing."
17|97|and whoever allah guid - he is the [rightly] guided; and whoever He send astray - you will never find for them protector besid him, and We will gather them on the day of resurrect [fallen] on their face - blind, dumb and deaf. their refug is hell; everi time it subsid We increas them in blaze fire.
17|98|that is their recompens becaus they disbeliev in our vers and said, "when we are bone and crumbl particles, will we [truly] be resurrect [in] a new creation?"
17|99|do they not see that allah, who creat the heaven and earth, is [the one] abl to creat the like of them? and He ha appoint for them a term, about which there is no doubt. but the wrongdoer refus [anything] except disbelief.
17|100|say [to them], "if you possess the depositori of the merci of my lord, then you would withhold out of fear of spending." and ever ha man been stingy.
17|101|and We had certainli given mose nine evid signs, so ask the children of israel [about] when he came to them and pharaoh said to him, "inde I think, O moses, that you are affect by magic."
17|102|[moses] said, "you have alreadi known that none ha sent down these [signs] except the lord of the heaven and the earth as evidence, and inde I think, O pharaoh, that you are destroyed."
17|103|so he intend to drive them from the land, but We drown him and those with him all together.
17|104|and We said after pharaoh to the children of israel, "dwell in the land, and when there come the promis of the hereafter, We will bring you forth in [one] gathering."
17|105|and with the truth We have sent the qur'an down, and with the truth it ha descended. and We have not sent you, [O muhammad], except as a bringer of good tide and a warner.
17|106|and [it is] a qur'an which We have separ [bi intervals] that you might recit it to the peopl over a prolong period. and We have sent it down progressively.
17|107|say, "believ in it or do not believe. indeed, those who were given knowledg befor it - when it is recit to them, they fall upon their face in prostration,
17|108|and they say, "exalt is our lord! indeed, the promis of our lord ha been fulfilled."
17|109|and they fall upon their face weeping, and the qur'an increas them in humbl submission.
17|110|say, "call upon allah or call upon the most merciful. whichev [name] you call - to him belong the best names." and do not recit [too] loudli in your prayer or [too] quietli but seek between that an [intermediate] way.
17|111|and say, "prais to allah, who ha not taken a son and ha had no partner in [his] dominion and ha no [need of a] protector out of weakness; and glorifi him with [great] glorification."
18|1|[all] prais is [due] to allah, who ha sent down upon hi servant the book and ha not made therein ani deviance.
18|2|[h ha made it] straight, to warn of sever punish from him and to give good tide to the believ who do righteou deed that they will have a good reward
18|3|in which they will remain forever
18|4|and to warn those who say, "allah ha taken a son."
18|5|they have no knowledg of it, nor had their fathers. grave is the word that come out of their mouths; they speak not except a lie.
18|6|then perhap you would kill yourself through grief over them, [O muhammad], if they do not believ in thi message, [and] out of sorrow.
18|7|indeed, We have made that which is on the earth adorn for it that We may test them [a to] which of them is best in deed.
18|8|and indeed, We will make that which is upon it [into] a barren ground.
18|9|or have you thought that the companion of the cave and the inscript were, among our signs, a wonder?
18|10|[mention] when the youth retreat to the cave and said, "our lord, grant us from yourself merci and prepar for us from our affair right guidance."
18|11|so We cast [a cover of sleep] over their ear within the cave for a number of years.
18|12|then We awaken them that We might show which of the two faction wa most precis in calcul what [extent] they had remain in time.
18|13|it is We who relat to you, [O muhammad], their stori in truth. indeed, they were youth who believ in their lord, and We increas them in guidance.
18|14|and We made firm their heart when they stood up and said, "our lord is the lord of the heaven and the earth. never will we invok besid him ani deity. We would have certainli spoken, then, an excess transgression.
18|15|these, our people, have taken besid him deities. whi do they not bring for [worship of] them a clear authority? and who is more unjust than one who invent about allah a lie?"
18|16|[th youth said to one another], "and when you have withdrawn from them and that which they worship other than allah, retreat to the cave. your lord will spread out for you of hi merci and will prepar for you from your affair facility."
18|17|and [had you been present], you would see the sun when it rose, inclin away from their cave on the right, and when it set, pass away from them on the left, while they were [laying] within an open space thereof. that wa from the sign of allah. He whom allah guid is the [rightly] guided, but he whom He leav astray - never will you find for him a protect guide.
18|18|and you would think them awake, while they were asleep. and We turn them to the right and to the left, while their dog stretch hi foreleg at the entrance. If you had look at them, you would have turn from them in flight and been fill by them with terror.
18|19|and similarly, We awaken them that they might question one another. said a speaker from among them, "how long have you remain [here]?" they said, "we have remain a day or part of a day." they said, "your lord is most know of how long you remained. So send one of you with thi silver coin of your to the citi and let him look to which is the best of food and bring you provis from it and let him be cautious. and let no one be awar of you.
18|20|indeed, if they come to know of you, they will stone you or return you to their religion. and never would you succeed, then - ever."
18|21|and similarly, We caus them to be found that they [who found them] would know that the promis of allah is truth and that of the hour there is no doubt. [that was] when they disput among themselv about their affair and [then] said, "construct over them a structure. their lord is most know about them." said those who prevail in the matter, "we will sure take [for ourselves] over them a masjid."
18|22|they will say there were three, the fourth of them be their dog; and they will say there were five, the sixth of them be their dog - guess at the unseen; and they will say there were seven, and the eighth of them wa their dog. say, [O muhammad], "mi lord is most know of their number. none know them except a few. So do not argu about them except with an obviou argument and do not inquir about them among [the speculators] from anyone."
18|23|and never say of anything, "indeed, I will do that tomorrow,"
18|24|except [when adding], "if allah wills." and rememb your lord when you forget [it] and say, "perhap my lord will guid me to what is nearer than thi to right conduct."
18|25|and they remain in their cave for three hundr year and exceed by nine.
18|26|say, "allah is most know of how long they remained. He ha [knowledg of] the unseen [aspects] of the heaven and the earth. how see is He and how hearing! they have not besid him ani protector, and He share not hi legisl with anyone."
18|27|and recite, [O muhammad], what ha been reveal to you of the book of your lord. there is no changer of hi words, and never will you find in other than him a refuge.
18|28|and keep yourself patient [bi being] with those who call upon their lord in the morn and the evening, seek hi countenance. and let not your eye pass beyond them, desir adorn of the worldli life, and do not obey one whose heart We have made heedless of our remembr and who follow hi desir and whose affair is ever [in] neglect.
18|29|and say, "the truth is from your lord, so whoever will - let him believe; and whoever will - let him disbelieve." indeed, We have prepar for the wrongdoer a fire whose wall will surround them. and if they call for relief, they will be reliev with water like murki oil, which scald [their] faces. wretch is the drink, and evil is the rest place.
18|30|indeed, those who have believ and done righteou deed - indeed, We will not allow to be lost the reward of ani who did well in deeds.
18|31|thos will have garden of perpetu residence; beneath them river will flow. they will be adorn therein with bracelet of gold and will wear green garment of fine silk and brocade, reclin therein on adorn couches. excel is the reward, and good is the rest place.
18|32|and present to them an exampl of two men: We grant to one of them two garden of grapevines, and We border them with palm tree and place between them [field of] crops.
18|33|each of the two garden produc it fruit and did not fall short thereof in anything. and We caus to gush forth within them a river.
18|34|and he had fruit, so he said to hi companion while he wa convers with him, "I am greater than you in wealth and mightier in [number of] men."
18|35|and he enter hi garden while he wa unjust to himself. He said, "I do not think that thi will perish - ever.
18|36|and I do not think the hour will occur. and even if I should be brought back to my lord, I will sure find better than thi as a return."
18|37|hi companion said to him while he wa convers with him, "have you disbeliev in He who creat you from dust and then from a sperm-drop and then proport you [as] a man?
18|38|but as for me, He is allah, my lord, and I do not associ with my lord anyone.
18|39|and whi did you, when you enter your garden, not say, 'what allah will [ha occurred]; there is no power except in allah '? although you see me less than you in wealth and children,
18|40|it may be that my lord will give me [something] better than your garden and will send upon it a calam from the sky, and it will becom a smooth, dusti ground,
18|41|or it water will becom sunken [into the earth], so you would never be abl to seek it."
18|42|and hi fruit were encompass [bi ruin], so he began to turn hi hand about [in dismay] over what he had spent on it, while it had collaps upon it trellises, and said, "oh, I wish I had not associ with my lord anyone."
18|43|and there wa for him no compani to aid him other than allah, nor could he defend himself.
18|44|ther the author is [completely] for allah, the truth. He is best in reward and best in outcome.
18|45|and present to them the exampl of the life of thi world, [it being] like rain which We send down from the sky, and the veget of the earth mingl with it and [then] it becom dri remnants, scatter by the winds. and allah is ever, over all things, perfect in ability.
18|46|wealth and children are [but] adorn of the worldli life. but the endur good deed are better to your lord for reward and better for [one's] hope.
18|47|and [warn of] the day when We will remov the mountain and you will see the earth prominent, and We will gather them and not leav behind from them anyone.
18|48|and they will be present befor your lord in rows, [and He will say], "you have certainli come to Us just as We creat you the first time. but you claim that We would never make for you an appointment."
18|49|and the record [of deeds] will be place [open], and you will see the crimin fear of that within it, and they will say, "oh, woe to us! what is thi book that leav noth small or great except that it ha enumer it?" and they will find what they did present [befor them]. and your lord doe injustic to no one.
18|50|and [mention] when We said to the angels, "prostrat to adam," and they prostrated, except for iblees. He wa of the jinn and depart from the command of hi lord. then will you take him and hi descend as alli other than Me while they are enemi to you? wretch it is for the wrongdoer as an exchange.
18|51|i did not make them wit to the creation of the heaven and the earth or to the creation of themselves, and I would not have taken the misguid as assistants.
18|52|and [warn of] the day when He will say, "call 'mi partners' whom you claimed," and they will invok them, but they will not respond to them. and We will put between them [a valley of] destruction.
18|53|and the crimin will see the fire and will be certain that they are to fall therein. and they will not find from it a way elsewhere.
18|54|and We have certainli diversifi in thi qur'an for the peopl from everi [kind of] example; but man ha ever been, most of anything, [prone to] dispute.
18|55|and noth ha prevent the peopl from believ when guidanc came to them and from ask forgiv of their lord except that there [must] befal them the [accustomed] preced of the former peopl or that the punish should come [directly] befor them.
18|56|and We send not the messeng except as bringer of good tide and warners. and those who disbeliev disput by [using] falsehood to [attempt to] invalid therebi the truth and have taken My verses, and that of which they are warned, in ridicule.
18|57|and who is more unjust than one who is remind of the vers of hi lord but turn away from them and forget what hi hand have put forth? indeed, We have place over their heart coverings, lest they understand it, and in their ear deafness. and if you invit them to guidanc - they will never be guided, then - ever.
18|58|and your lord is the forgiving, full of mercy. If He were to impos blame upon them for what they earned, He would have hasten for them the punishment. rather, for them is an appoint from which they will never find an escape.
18|59|and those citi - We destroy them when they wronged, and We made for their destruct an appoint time.
18|60|and [mention] when mose said to hi servant, "I will not ceas [traveling] until I reach the junction of the two sea or continu for a long period."
18|61|but when they reach the junction between them, they forgot their fish, and it took it cours into the sea, slip away.
18|62|so when they had pass beyond it, [moses] said to hi boy, "bring us our morn meal. We have certainli suffer in this, our journey, [much] fatigue."
18|63|h said, "did you see when we retir to the rock? indeed, I forgot [there] the fish. and none made me forget it except satan - that I should mention it. and it took it cours into the sea amazingly".
18|64|[moses] said, "that is what we were seeking." So they returned, follow their footprints.
18|65|and they found a servant from among our servant to whom we had given merci from us and had taught him from Us a [certain] knowledge.
18|66|mos said to him, "may I follow you on [the condition] that you teach me from what you have been taught of sound judgement?"
18|67|h said, "indeed, with me you will never be abl to have patience.
18|68|and how can you have patienc for what you do not encompass in knowledge?"
18|69|[moses] said, "you will find me, if allah wills, patient, and I will not disobey you in [any] order."
18|70|h said, "then if you follow me, do not ask me about anyth until I make to you about it mention."
18|71|so they set out, until when they had embark on the ship, al-khidh r tore it open. [moses] said, "have you torn it open to drown it people? you have certainli done a grave thing."
18|72|[al-khidh r] said, "did I not say that with me you would never be abl to have patience?"
18|73|[moses] said, "do not blame me for what I forgot and do not cover me in my matter with difficulty."
18|74|so they set out, until when they met a boy, al-khidh r kill him. [moses] said, "have you kill a pure soul for other than [have killed] a soul? you have certainli done a deplor thing."
18|75|[al-khidh r] said, "did I not tell you that with me you would never be abl to have patience?"
18|76|[moses] said, "if I should ask you about anyth after this, then do not keep me as a companion. you have obtain from me an excuse."
18|77|so they set out, until when they came to the peopl of a town, they ask it peopl for food, but they refus to offer them hospitality. and they found therein a wall about to collapse, so al-khidh r restor it. [moses] said, "if you wished, you could have taken for it a payment."
18|78|[al-khidh r] said, "thi is part between me and you. I will inform you of the interpret of that about which you could not have patience.
18|79|a for the ship, it belong to poor peopl work at sea. So I intend to caus defect in it as there wa after them a king who seiz everi [good] ship by force.
18|80|and as for the boy, hi parent were believers, and we fear that he would overburden them by transgress and disbelief.
18|81|so we intend that their lord should substitut for them one better than him in puriti and nearer to mercy.
18|82|and as for the wall, it belong to two orphan boy in the city, and there wa beneath it a treasur for them, and their father had been righteous. So your lord intend that they reach matur and extract their treasure, as a merci from your lord. and I did it not of my own accord. that is the interpret of that about which you could not have patience."
18|83|and they ask you, [O muhammad], about dhul-qarnayn. say, "I will recit to you about him a report."
18|84|inde We establish him upon the earth, and We gave him to everyth a way.
18|85|so he follow a way
18|86|until, when he reach the set of the sun, he found it [a if] set in a spring of dark mud, and he found near it a people. allah said, "O dhul-qarnayn, either you punish [them] or els adopt among them [a way of] goodness."
18|87|h said, "a for one who wrongs, we will punish him. then he will be return to hi lord, and He will punish him with a terribl punishment.
18|88|but as for one who believ and doe righteousness, he will have a reward of paradise, and we will speak to him from our command with ease."
18|89|then he follow a way
18|90|until, when he came to the rise of the sun, he found it rise on a peopl for whom We had not made against it ani shield.
18|91|thus. and We had encompass [all] that he had in knowledge.
18|92|then he follow a way
18|93|until, when he reach [a pass] between two mountains, he found besid them a peopl who could hardli understand [his] speech.
18|94|they said, "O dhul-qarnayn, inde gog and magog are [great] corrupt in the land. So may we assign for you an expenditur that you might make between us and them a barrier?"
18|95|h said, "that in which my lord ha establish me is better [than what you offer], but assist me with strength; I will make between you and them a dam.
18|96|br me sheet of iron" - until, when he had level [them] between the two mountain walls, he said, "blow [with bellows]," until when he had made it [like] fire, he said, "bring me, that I may pour over it molten copper."
18|97|so gog and magog were unabl to pass over it, nor were they abl [to effect] in it ani penetration.
18|98|[dhul-qarnayn] said, "thi is a merci from my lord; but when the promis of my lord comes, He will make it level, and ever is the promis of my lord true."
18|99|and We will leav them that day surg over each other, and [then] the horn will be blown, and We will assembl them in [one] assembly.
18|100|and We will present hell that day to the disbelievers, on display -
18|101|those whose eye had been within a cover [removed] from My remembrance, and they were not abl to hear.
18|102|then do those who disbeliev think that they can take My servant instead of Me as allies? indeed, We have prepar hell for the disbeliev as a lodging.
18|103|say, [O muhammad], "shall we [believers] inform you of the greatest loser as to [their] deeds?
18|104|[they are] those whose effort is lost in worldli life, while they think that they are do well in work."
18|105|thos are the one who disbeliev in the vers of their lord and in [their] meet him, so their deed have becom worthless; and We will not assign to them on the day of resurrect ani importance.
18|106|that is their recompens - hell - for what they deni and [because] they took My sign and My messeng in ridicule.
18|107|indeed, those who have believ and done righteou deed - they will have the garden of paradis as a lodging,
18|108|wherein they abid eternally. they will not desir from it ani transfer.
18|109|say, "if the sea were ink for [writing] the word of my lord, the sea would be exhaust befor the word of my lord were exhausted, even if We brought the like of it as a supplement."
18|110|say, "I am onli a man like you, to whom ha been reveal that your god is one god. So whoever would hope for the meet with hi lord - let him do righteou work and not associ in the worship of hi lord anyone."
19|1|kaf, ha, ya, 'ayn, sad.
19|2|[thi is] a mention of the merci of your lord to hi servant zechariah
19|3|when he call to hi lord a privat supplication.
19|4|h said, "mi lord, inde my bone have weakened, and my head ha fill with white, and never have I been in my supplic to you, my lord, unhappy.
19|5|and indeed, I fear the successor after me, and my wife ha been barren, so give me from yourself an heir
19|6|who will inherit me and inherit from the famili of jacob. and make him, my lord, pleas [to you]."
19|7|[h wa told], "O zechariah, inde We give you good tide of a boy whose name will be john. We have not assign to ani befor [this] name."
19|8|h said, "mi lord, how will I have a boy when my wife ha been barren and I have reach extrem old age?"
19|9|[an angel] said, "thu [it will be]; your lord says, 'it is easi for me, for I creat you before, while you were nothing.' "
19|10|[zechariah] said, "mi lord, make for me a sign." He said, "your sign is that you will not speak to the peopl for three nights, [being] sound."
19|11|so he came out to hi peopl from the prayer chamber and signal to them to exalt [allah] in the morn and afternoon.
19|12|[allah] said, "O john, take the scriptur with determination." and We gave him judgement [while yet] a boy
19|13|and affect from Us and purity, and he wa fear of allah
19|14|and duti to hi parents, and he wa not a disobedi tyrant.
19|15|and peac be upon him the day he wa born and the day he die and the day he is rais alive.
19|16|and mention, [O muhammad], in the book [the stori of] mary, when she withdrew from her famili to a place toward the east.
19|17|and she took, in seclus from them, a screen. then We sent to her our angel, and he repres himself to her as a well-proport man.
19|18|sh said, "indeed, I seek refug in the most merci from you, [so leav me], if you should be fear of allah."
19|19|h said, "I am onli the messeng of your lord to give you [new of] a pure boy."
19|20|sh said, "how can I have a boy while no man ha touch me and I have not been unchaste?"
19|21|h said, "thu [it will be]; your lord says, 'it is easi for me, and We will make him a sign to the peopl and a merci from us. and it is a matter [already] decreed.' "
19|22|so she conceiv him, and she withdrew with him to a remot place.
19|23|and the pain of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. she said, "oh, I wish I had die befor thi and wa in oblivion, forgotten."
19|24|but he call her from below her, "do not grieve; your lord ha provid beneath you a stream.
19|25|and shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree; it will drop upon you ripe, fresh dates.
19|26|so eat and drink and be contented. and if you see from among human anyone, say, 'indeed, I have vow to the most merci abstention, so I will not speak today to [any] man.' "
19|27|then she brought him to her people, carri him. they said, "O mary, you have certainli done a thing unprecedented.
19|28|o sister of aaron, your father wa not a man of evil, nor wa your mother unchaste."
19|29|so she point to him. they said, "how can we speak to one who is in the cradl a child?"
19|30|[jesus] said, "indeed, I am the servant of allah. He ha given me the scriptur and made me a prophet.
19|31|and He ha made me bless wherev I am and ha enjoin upon me prayer and zakah as long as I remain alive
19|32|and [made me] duti to my mother, and He ha not made me a wretch tyrant.
19|33|and peac is on me the day I wa born and the day I will die and the day I am rais alive."
19|34|that is jesus, the son of mari - the word of truth about which they are in dispute.
19|35|it is not [befitting] for allah to take a son; exalt is he! when He decre an affair, He onli say to it, "be," and it is.
19|36|[jesu said], "and indeed, allah is my lord and your lord, so worship him. that is a straight path."
19|37|then the faction differ [concern jesus] from among them, so woe to those who disbeliev - from the scene of a tremend day.
19|38|how [clearly] they will hear and see the day they come to us, but the wrongdoer today are in clear error.
19|39|and warn them, [O muhammad], of the day of regret, when the matter will be concluded; and [yet], they are in [a state of] heedlessness, and they do not believe.
19|40|indeed, it is We who will inherit the earth and whoever is on it, and to Us they will be returned.
19|41|and mention in the book [the stori of] abraham. indeed, he wa a man of truth and a prophet.
19|42|[mention] when he said to hi father, "O my father, whi do you worship that which doe not hear and doe not see and will not benefit you at all?
19|43|o my father, inde there ha come to me of knowledg that which ha not come to you, so follow me; I will guid you to an even path.
19|44|o my father, do not worship satan. inde satan ha ever been, to the most merciful, disobedient.
19|45|o my father, inde I fear that there will touch you a punish from the most merci so you would be to satan a companion [in hellfire]."
19|46|[hi father] said, "have you no desir for my gods, O abraham? If you do not desist, I will sure stone you, so avoid me a prolong time."
19|47|[abraham] said, "peac will be upon you. I will ask forgiv for you of my lord. indeed, He is ever graciou to me.
19|48|and I will leav you and those you invok other than allah and will invok my lord. I expect that I will not be in invoc to my lord unhappy."
19|49|so when he had left them and those they worship other than allah, We gave him isaac and jacob, and each [of them] We made a prophet.
19|50|and We gave them of our mercy, and we made for them a reput of high honor.
19|51|and mention in the book, moses. indeed, he wa chosen, and he wa a messeng and a prophet.
19|52|and We call him from the side of the mount at [his] right and brought him near, confid [to him].
19|53|and We gave him out of our merci hi brother aaron as a prophet.
19|54|and mention in the book, ishmael. indeed, he wa true to hi promise, and he wa a messeng and a prophet.
19|55|and he use to enjoin on hi peopl prayer and zakah and wa to hi lord pleasing.
19|56|and mention in the book, idrees. indeed, he wa a man of truth and a prophet.
19|57|and We rais him to a high station.
19|58|thos were the one upon whom allah bestow favor from among the prophet of the descend of adam and of those We carri [in the ship] with noah, and of the descend of abraham and israel, and of those whom We guid and chose. when the vers of the most merci were recit to them, they fell in prostrat and weeping.
19|59|but there came after them successor who neglect prayer and pursu desires; so they are go to meet evil -
19|60|except those who repent, believ and do righteousness; for those will enter paradis and will not be wrong at all.
19|61|[therein are] garden of perpetu resid which the most merci ha promis hi servant in the unseen. indeed, hi promis ha ever been coming.
19|62|they will not hear therein ani ill speech - onli [greet of] peac - and they will have their provis therein, morn and afternoon.
19|63|that is paradise, which We give as inherit to those of our servant who were fear of allah.
19|64|[gabriel said], "and we [angels] descend not except by the order of your lord. To him belong that befor us and that behind us and what is in between. and never is your lord forget -
19|65|lord of the heaven and the earth and whatev is between them - so worship him and have patienc for hi worship. Do you know of ani similar to him?"
19|66|and the disbeliev says, "when I have died, am I go to be brought forth alive?"
19|67|do man not rememb that We creat him before, while he wa nothing?
19|68|so by your lord, We will sure gather them and the devils; then We will bring them to be present around hell upon their knees.
19|69|then We will sure extract from everi sect those of them who were worst against the most merci in insolence.
19|70|then, sure it is We who are most know of those most worthi of burn therein.
19|71|and there is none of you except he will come to it. thi is upon your lord an inevit decreed.
19|72|then We will save those who fear allah and leav the wrongdoer within it, on their knees.
19|73|and when our vers are recit to them as clear evidences, those who disbeliev say to those who believe, "which of [our] two parti is best in posit and best in association?"
19|74|and how mani a gener have We destroy befor them who were better in possess and [outward] appearance?
19|75|say, "whoever is in error - let the most merci extend for him an extens [in wealth and time] until, when they see that which they were promis - either punish [in thi world] or the hour [of resurrection] - they will come to know who is worst in posit and weaker in soldiers."
19|76|and allah increas those who were guided, in guidance, and the endur good deed are better to your lord for reward and better for recourse.
19|77|then, have you seen he who disbeliev in our vers and said, "I will sure be given wealth and children [in the next life]?"
19|78|ha he look into the unseen, or ha he taken from the most merci a promise?
19|79|no! We will record what he say and extend for him from the punish extensively.
19|80|and We will inherit him [in] what he mentions, and he will come to Us alone.
19|81|and they have taken besid allah [false] deiti that they would be for them [a sourc of] honor.
19|82|no! those "gods" will deni their worship of them and will be against them oppon [on the day of judgement].
19|83|do you not see that We have sent the devil upon the disbelievers, incit them to [evil] with [constant] incitement?
19|84|so be not impati over them. We onli count out to them a [limited] number.
19|85|on the day We will gather the righteou to the most merci as a delegation
19|86|and will drive the crimin to hell in thirst
19|87|non will have [power of] intercess except he who had taken from the most merci a covenant.
19|88|and they say, "the most merci ha taken [for himself] a son."
19|89|you have done an atroci thing.
19|90|th heaven almost ruptur therefrom and the earth split open and the mountain collaps in devastation
19|91|that they attribut to the most merci a son.
19|92|and it is not appropri for the most merci that He should take a son.
19|93|ther is no one in the heaven and earth but that he come to the most merci as a servant.
19|94|h ha enumer them and count them a [full] counting.
19|95|and all of them are come to him on the day of resurrect alone.
19|96|indeed, those who have believ and done righteou deed - the most merci will appoint for them affection.
19|97|so, [O muhammad], We have onli made qur'an easi in the arab languag that you may give good tide therebi to the righteou and warn therebi a hostil people.
19|98|and how mani have We destroy befor them of generations? Do you perceiv of them anyon or hear from them a sound?
20|1|ta, ha.
20|2|w have not sent down to you the qur'an that you be distressed
20|3|but onli as a remind for those who fear [allah] -
20|4|a revel from He who creat the earth and highest heavens,
20|5|th most merci [who is] abov the throne established.
20|6|to him belong what is in the heaven and what is on the earth and what is between them and what is under the soil.
20|7|and if you speak aloud - then indeed, He know the secret and what is [even] more hidden.
20|8|allah - there is no deiti except him. To him belong the best names.
20|9|and ha the stori of mose reach you? -
20|10|when he saw a fire and said to hi family, "stay here; indeed, I have perceiv a fire; perhap I can bring you a torch or find at the fire some guidance."
20|11|and when he came to it, he wa called, "O moses,
20|12|indeed, I am your lord, so remov your sandals. indeed, you are in the sacr valley of tuwa.
20|13|and I have chosen you, so listen to what is reveal [to you].
20|14|indeed, I am allah. there is no deiti except me, so worship Me and establish prayer for My remembrance.
20|15|indeed, the hour is come - I almost conceal it - so that everi soul may be recompens accord to that for which it strives.
20|16|so do not let one avert you from it who doe not believ in it and follow hi desire, for you [then] would perish.
20|17|and what is that in your right hand, O moses?"
20|18|h said, "it is my staff; I lean upon it, and I bring down leav for my sheep and I have therein other uses."
20|19|[allah] said, "throw it down, O moses."
20|20|so he threw it down, and thereupon it wa a snake, move swiftly.
20|21|[allah] said, "seiz it and fear not; We will return it to it former condition.
20|22|and draw in your hand to your side; it will come out white without diseas - anoth sign,
20|23|that We may show you [some] of our greater signs.
20|24|go to pharaoh. indeed, he ha transgressed."
20|25|[moses] said, "mi lord, expand for me my breast [with assurance]
20|26|and eas for me my task
20|27|and unti the knot from my tongue
20|28|that they may understand my speech.
20|29|and appoint for me a minist from my famili -
20|30|aaron, my brother.
20|31|increas through him my strength
20|32|and let him share my task
20|33|that we may exalt you much
20|34|and rememb you much.
20|35|indeed, you are of us ever seeing."
20|36|[allah] said, "you have been grant your request, O moses.
20|37|and We had alreadi confer favor upon you anoth time,
20|38|when We inspir to your mother what We inspired,
20|39|[saying], 'cast him into the chest and cast it into the river, and the river will throw it onto the bank; there will take him an enemi to Me and an enemi to him.' and I bestow upon you love from Me that you would be brought up under My eye.
20|40|[and We favor you] when your sister went and said, 'shall I direct you to someon who will be respons for him?' So We restor you to your mother that she might be content and not grieve. and you kill someone, but We save you from retali and tri you with a [severe] trial. and you remain [some] year among the peopl of madyan. then you came [here] at the decre time, O moses.
20|41|and I produc you for myself.
20|42|go, you and your brother, with My sign and do not slacken in My remembrance.
20|43|go, both of you, to pharaoh. indeed, he ha transgressed.
20|44|and speak to him with gentl speech that perhap he may be remind or fear [allah]."
20|45|they said, "our lord, inde we are afraid that he will hasten [punishment] against us or that he will transgress."
20|46|[allah] said, "fear not. indeed, I am with you both; I hear and I see.
20|47|so go to him and say, 'indeed, we are messeng of your lord, so send with us the children of israel and do not torment them. We have come to you with a sign from your lord. and peac will be upon he who follow the guidance.
20|48|indeed, it ha been reveal to us that the punish will be upon whoever deni and turn away.' "
20|49|[pharaoh] said, "so who is the lord of you two, O moses?"
20|50|h said, "our lord is He who gave each thing it form and then guid [it]."
20|51|[pharaoh] said, "then what is the case of the former generations?"
20|52|[moses] said, "the knowledg thereof is with my lord in a record. My lord neither err nor forgets."
20|53|[it is he] who ha made for you the earth as a bed [spread out] and insert therein for you roadway and sent down from the sky, rain and produc therebi categori of variou plants.
20|54|eat [therefrom] and pastur your livestock. indeed, in that are sign for those of intelligence.
20|55|from the earth We creat you, and into it We will return you, and from it We will extract you anoth time.
20|56|and We certainli show pharaoh our sign - all of them - but he deni and refused.
20|57|h said, "have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic, O moses?
20|58|then we will sure bring you magic like it, so make between us and you an appointment, which we will not fail to keep and neither will you, in a place assigned."
20|59|[moses] said, "your appoint is on the day of the festiv when the peopl assembl at mid-morning."
20|60|so pharaoh went away, put togeth hi plan, and then came [to moses].
20|61|mos said to the magician summon by pharaoh, "woe to you! Do not invent a lie against allah or He will extermin you with a punishment; and he ha fail who invent [such falsehood]."
20|62|so they disput over their affair among themselv and conceal their privat conversation.
20|63|they said, "indeed, these are two magician who want to drive you out of your land with their magic and do away with your most exemplari way.
20|64|so resolv upon your plan and then come [forward] in line. and he ha succeed today who overcomes."
20|65|they said, "O moses, either you throw or we will be the first to throw."
20|66|h said, "rather, you throw." and suddenli their rope and staff seem to him from their magic that they were move [like snakes].
20|67|and he sens within himself apprehension, did moses.
20|68|allah said, "fear not. indeed, it is you who are superior.
20|69|and throw what is in your right hand; it will swallow up what they have crafted. what they have craft is but the trick of a magician, and the magician will not succeed wherev he is."
20|70|so the magician fell down in prostration. they said, "we have believ in the lord of aaron and moses."
20|71|[pharaoh] said, "you believ him befor I gave you permission. indeed, he is your leader who ha taught you magic. So I will sure cut off your hand and your feet on opposit sides, and I will crucifi you on the trunk of palm trees, and you will sure know which of us is more sever in [giving] punish and more enduring."
20|72|they said, "never will we prefer you over what ha come to us of clear proof and [over] He who creat us. So decre whatev you are to decree. you can onli decre for thi worldli life.
20|73|indeed, we have believ in our lord that He may forgiv us our sin and what you compel us [to do] of magic. and allah is better and more enduring."
20|74|indeed, whoever come to hi lord as a crimin - indeed, for him is hell; he will neither die therein nor live.
20|75|but whoever come to him as a believ have done righteou deed - for those will be the highest degre [in position]:
20|76|garden of perpetu resid beneath which river flow, wherein they abid eternally. and that is the reward of one who purifi himself.
20|77|and We had inspir to moses, "travel by night with My servant and strike for them a dri path through the sea; you will not fear be overtaken [bi pharaoh] nor be afraid [of drowning]."
20|78|so pharaoh pursu them with hi soldiers, and there cover them from the sea that which cover them,
20|79|and pharaoh led hi peopl astray and did not guid [them].
20|80|o children of israel, We deliv you from your enemy, and We made an appoint with you at the right side of the mount, and We sent down to you manna and quails,
20|81|[saying], "eat from the good thing with which We have provid you and do not transgress [or oppress others] therein, lest My anger should descend upon you. and he upon whom My anger descend ha certainli fallen."
20|82|but indeed, I am the perpetu forgiv of whoever repent and believ and doe righteous and then continu in guidance.
20|83|[allah] said, "and what made you hasten from your people, O moses?"
20|84|h said, "they are close upon my tracks, and I hasten to you, my lord, that you be pleased."
20|85|[allah] said, "but indeed, We have tri your peopl after you [departed], and the samiri ha led them astray."
20|86|so mose return to hi people, angri and grieved. He said, "O my people, did your lord not make you a good promise? then, wa the time [of it fulfillment] too long for you, or did you wish that wrath from your lord descend upon you, so you broke your promis [of obedience] to me?"
20|87|they said, "we did not break our promis to you by our will, but we were made to carri burden from the ornament of the peopl [of pharaoh], so we threw them [into the fire], and thu did the samiri throw."
20|88|and he extract for them [the statu of] a calf which had a low sound, and they said, "thi is your god and the god of moses, but he forgot."
20|89|did they not see that it could not return to them ani speech and that it did not possess for them ani harm or benefit?
20|90|and aaron had alreadi told them befor [the return of moses], "O my people, you are onli be test by it, and indeed, your lord is the most merciful, so follow me and obey my order."
20|91|they said, "we will never ceas be devot to the calf until mose return to us."
20|92|[moses] said, "O aaron, what prevent you, when you saw them go astray,
20|93|from follow me? then have you disobey my order?"
20|94|[aaron] said, "O son of my mother, do not seiz [me] by my beard or by my head. indeed, I fear that you would say, 'you caus divis among the children of israel, and you did not observ [or await] my word.' "
20|95|[moses] said, "and what is your case, O samiri?"
20|96|h said, "I saw what they did not see, so I took a hand [of dust] from the track of the messeng and threw it, and thu did my soul entic me."
20|97|[moses] said, "then go. and indeed, it is [decreed] for you in [this] life to say, 'no contact.' and indeed, you have an appoint [in the hereafter] you will not fail to keep. and look at your 'god' to which you remain devoted. We will sure burn it and blow it into the sea with a blast.
20|98|your god is onli allah, except for whom there is no deity. He ha encompass all thing in knowledge."
20|99|thus, [O muhammad], We relat to you from the news of what ha preceded. and We have certainli given you from Us the qur'an.
20|100|whoev turn away from it - then indeed, he will bear on the day of resurrect a burden,
20|101|[abiding] etern therein, and evil it is for them on the day of resurrect as a load -
20|102|the day the horn will be blown. and We will gather the criminals, that day, blue-eyed.
20|103|they will murmur among themselves, "you remain not but ten [day in the world]."
20|104|w are most know of what they say when the best of them in manner will say, "you remain not but one day."
20|105|and they ask you about the mountains, so say, "mi lord will blow them away with a blast.
20|106|and He will leav the earth a level plain;
20|107|you will not see therein a depress or an elevation."
20|108|that day, everyon will follow [the call of] the caller [with] no deviat therefrom, and [all] voic will be still befor the most merciful, so you will not hear except a whisper [of footsteps].
20|109|that day, no intercess will benefit except [that of] one to whom the most merci ha given permiss and ha accept hi word.
20|110|allah know what is [presently] befor them and what will be after them, but they do not encompass it in knowledge.
20|111|and [all] face will be humbl befor the ever-living, the sustain of existence. and he will have fail who carri injustice.
20|112|but he who doe of righteou deed while he is a believ - he will neither fear injustic nor deprivation.
20|113|and thu We have sent it down as an arab qur'an and have diversifi therein the warn that perhap they will avoid [sin] or it would caus them remembrance.
20|114|so high [abov all] is allah, the sovereign, the truth. and, [O muhammad], do not hasten with [recit of] the qur'an befor it revel is complet to you, and say, "mi lord, increas me in knowledge."
20|115|and We had alreadi taken a promis from adam before, but he forgot; and We found not in him determination.
20|116|and [mention] when We said to the angels, "prostrat to adam," and they prostrated, except iblees; he refused.
20|117|so We said, "O adam, inde thi is an enemi to you and to your wife. then let him not remov you from paradis so you would suffer.
20|118|indeed, it is [promised] for you not to be hungri therein or be unclothed.
20|119|and indeed, you will not be thirsti therein or be hot from the sun."
20|120|then satan whisper to him; he said, "O adam, shall I direct you to the tree of etern and possess that will not deteriorate?"
20|121|and adam and hi wife ate of it, and their privat part becam appar to them, and they began to fasten over themselv from the leav of paradise. and adam disobey hi lord and erred.
20|122|then hi lord chose him and turn to him in forgiv and guid [him].
20|123|[allah] said, "descend from paradis - all, [your descendants] be enemi to one another. and if there should come to you guidanc from Me - then whoever follow My guidanc will neither go astray [in the world] nor suffer [in the hereafter].
20|124|and whoever turn away from My remembr - indeed, he will have a depress life, and We will gather him on the day of resurrect blind."
20|125|h will say, "mi lord, whi have you rais me blind while I wa [once] seeing?"
20|126|[allah] will say, "thu did our sign come to you, and you forgot them; and thu will you thi day be forgotten."
20|127|and thu do We recompens he who transgress and did not believ in the sign of hi lord. and the punish of the hereaft is more sever and more enduring.
20|128|then, ha it not becom clear to them how mani gener We destroy befor them as they walk among their dwellings? inde in that are sign for those of intelligence.
20|129|and if not for a word that preced from your lord, punish would have been an oblig [due immediately], and [if not for] a specifi term [decreed].
20|130|so be patient over what they say and exalt [allah] with prais of your lord befor the rise of the sun and befor it setting; and dure period of the night [exalt him] and at the end of the day, that you may be satisfied.
20|131|and do not extend your eye toward that by which We have given enjoy to [some] categori of them, [it be but] the splendor of worldli life by which We test them. and the provis of your lord is better and more enduring.
20|132|and enjoin prayer upon your famili [and people] and be steadfast therein. We ask you not for provision; We provid for you, and the [best] outcom is for [those of] righteousness.
20|133|and they say, "whi doe he not bring us a sign from hi lord?" ha there not come to them evid of what wa in the former scriptures?
20|134|and if We had destroy them with a punish befor him, they would have said, "our lord, whi did you not send to us a messeng so we could have follow your vers befor we were humili and disgraced?"
20|135|say, "each [of us] is waiting; so wait. for you will know who are the companion of the sound path and who is guided."
21|1|[th time of] their account ha approach for the people, while they are in heedless turn away.
21|2|no mention come to them anew from their lord except that they listen to it while they are at play
21|3|with their heart distracted. and those who do wrong conceal their privat conversation, [saying], "i thi [prophet] except a human be like you? So would you approach magic while you are awar [of it]?"
21|4|th prophet said, "mi lord know whatev is said throughout the heaven and earth, and He is the hearing, the knowing."
21|5|but they say, "[the revel is but] a mixtur of fals dreams; rather, he ha invent it; rather, he is a poet. So let him bring us a sign just as the previou [messengers] were sent [with miracles]."
21|6|not a [single] citi which We destroy believ befor them, so will they believe?
21|7|and We sent not befor you, [O muhammad], except men to whom We reveal [the message], so ask the peopl of the messag if you do not know.
21|8|and We did not make the prophet form not eat food, nor were they immort [on earth].
21|9|then We fulfil for them the promise, and We save them and whom We will and destroy the transgressors.
21|10|w have certainli sent down to you a book in which is your mention. then will you not reason?
21|11|and how mani a citi which wa unjust have We shatter and produc after it anoth people.
21|12|and when it inhabit perceiv our punishment, at onc they fled from it.
21|13|[som angel said], "do not flee but return to where you were given luxuri and to your home - perhap you will be questioned."
21|14|they said, "O woe to us! indeed, we were wrongdoers."
21|15|and that declar of their did not ceas until We made them [as] a harvest [mow down], extinguish [like a fire].
21|16|and We did not creat the heaven and earth and that between them in play.
21|17|had We intend to take a diversion, We could have taken it from [what is] with Us - if [indeed] We were to do so.
21|18|rather, We dash the truth upon falsehood, and it destroy it, and thereupon it departs. and for you is destruct from that which you describe.
21|19|to him belong whoever is in the heaven and the earth. and those near him are not prevent by arrog from hi worship, nor do they tire.
21|20|they exalt [him] night and day [and] do not slacken.
21|21|or have men taken for themselv god from the earth who resurrect [the dead]?
21|22|had there been within the heaven and earth god besid allah, they both would have been ruined. So exalt is allah, lord of the throne, abov what they describe.
21|23|h is not question about what He does, but they will be questioned.
21|24|or have they taken god besid him? say, [O muhammad], "produc your proof. thi [qur'an] is the messag for those with me and the messag of those befor me." but most of them do not know the truth, so they are turn away.
21|25|and We sent not befor you ani messeng except that We reveal to him that, "there is no deiti except me, so worship me."
21|26|and they say, "the most merci ha taken a son." exalt is he! rather, they are [but] honor servants.
21|27|they cannot preced him in word, and they act by hi command.
21|28|h know what is [presently] befor them and what will be after them, and they cannot interced except on behalf of one whom He approves. and they, from fear of him, are apprehensive.
21|29|and whoever of them should say, "indeed, I am a god besid him"- that one We would recompens with hell. thu do We recompens the wrongdoers.
21|30|hav those who disbeliev not consid that the heaven and the earth were a join entity, and We separ them and made from water everi live thing? then will they not believe?
21|31|and We place within the earth firmli set mountains, lest it should shift with them, and We made therein [mountain] pass [as] road that they might be guided.
21|32|and We made the sky a protect ceiling, but they, from it signs, are turn away.
21|33|and it is He who creat the night and the day and the sun and the moon; all [heavenli bodies] in an orbit are swimming.
21|34|and We did not grant to ani man befor you etern [on earth]; so if you die - would they be eternal?
21|35|everi soul will tast death. and We test you with evil and with good as trial; and to Us you will be returned.
21|36|and when those who disbeliev see you, [O muhammad], they take you not except in ridicule, [saying], "i thi the one who insult your gods?" and they are, at the mention of the most merciful, disbelievers.
21|37|man wa creat of haste. I will show you My signs, so do not impati urg me.
21|38|and they say, "when is thi promise, if you should be truthful?"
21|39|if those who disbeliev but knew the time when they will not avert the fire from their face or from their back and they will not be aided...
21|40|rather, it will come to them unexpectedli and bewild them, and they will not be abl to repel it, nor will they be reprieved.
21|41|and alreadi were messeng ridicul befor you, but those who mock them were envelop by what they use to ridicule.
21|42|say, "who can protect you at night or by day from the most merciful?" but they are, from the remembr of their lord, turn away.
21|43|or do they have god to defend them other than us? they are unabl [even] to help themselves, nor can they be protect from us.
21|44|but, [on the contrary], We have provid good thing for these [disbelievers] and their father until life wa prolong for them. then do they not see that We set upon the land, reduc it from it borders? So it is they who will overcome?
21|45|say, "I onli warn you by revelation." but the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned.
21|46|and if [a much as] a whiff of the punish of your lord should touch them, they would sure say, "O woe to us! indeed, we have been wrongdoers."
21|47|and We place the scale of justic for the day of resurrection, so no soul will be treat unjustli at all. and if there is [even] the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it forth. and suffici are We as accountant.
21|48|and We had alreadi given mose and aaron the criterion and a light and a remind for the righteous
21|49|who fear their lord unseen, while they are of the hour apprehensive.
21|50|and thi [qur'an] is a bless messag which We have sent down. then are you with it unacquainted?
21|51|and We had certainli given abraham hi sound judgement before, and We were of him well-knowing
21|52|when he said to hi father and hi people, "what are these statu to which you are devoted?"
21|53|they said, "we found our father worshipp of them."
21|54|h said, "you were certainly, you and your fathers, in manifest error."
21|55|they said, "have you come to us with truth, or are you of those who jest?"
21|56|h said, "[no], rather, your lord is the lord of the heaven and the earth who creat them, and I, to that, am of those who testify.
21|57|and [I swear] by allah, I will sure plan against your idol after you have turn and gone away."
21|58|so he made them into fragments, except a larg one among them, that they might return to it [and question].
21|59|they said, "who ha done thi to our gods? indeed, he is of the wrongdoers."
21|60|they said, "we heard a young man mention them who is call abraham."
21|61|they said, "then bring him befor the eye of the peopl that they may testify."
21|62|they said, "have you done thi to our gods, O abraham?"
21|63|h said, "rather, thi - the largest of them - did it, so ask them, if they should [be abl to] speak."
21|64|so they return to [blaming] themselv and said [to each other], "indeed, you are the wrongdoers."
21|65|then they revers themselves, [saying], "you have alreadi known that these do not speak!"
21|66|h said, "then do you worship instead of allah that which doe not benefit you at all or harm you?
21|67|uff to you and to what you worship instead of allah. then will you not use reason?"
21|68|they said, "burn him and support your god - if you are to act."
21|69|allah said, "O fire, be cool and safeti upon abraham."
21|70|and they intend for him harm, but We made them the greatest losers.
21|71|and We deliv him and lot to the land which We had bless for the worlds.
21|72|and We gave him isaac and jacob in addition, and all [of them] We made righteous.
21|73|and We made them leader guid by our command. and We inspir to them the do of good deeds, establish of prayer, and give of zakah; and they were worshipp of us.
21|74|and to lot We gave judgement and knowledge, and We save him from the citi that wa commit wick deeds. indeed, they were a peopl of evil, defiantli disobedient.
21|75|and We admit him into our mercy. indeed, he wa of the righteous.
21|76|and [mention] noah, when he call [to allah] befor [that time], so We respond to him and save him and hi famili from the great flood.
21|77|and We save him from the peopl who deni our signs. indeed, they were a peopl of evil, so We drown them, all together.
21|78|and [mention] david and solomon, when they judg concern the field - when the sheep of a peopl overran it [at night], and We were wit to their judgement.
21|79|and We gave understand of the case to solomon, and to each [of them] We gave judgement and knowledge. and We subject the mountain to exalt [us], along with david and [also] the birds. and We were do [that].
21|80|and We taught him the fashion of coat of armor to protect you from your [enemi in] battle. So will you then be grateful?
21|81|and to solomon [we subjected] the wind, blow forcefully, proceed by hi command toward the land which We had blessed. and We are ever, of all things, knowing.
21|82|and of the devil were those who dive for him and did work other than that. and We were of them a guardian.
21|83|and [mention] job, when he call to hi lord, "indeed, advers ha touch me, and you are the most merci of the merciful."
21|84|so We respond to him and remov what afflict him of adversity. and We gave him [back] hi famili and the like thereof with them as merci from Us and a remind for the worshipp [of allah].
21|85|and [mention] ishmael and idre and dhul-kifl; all were of the patient.
21|86|and We admit them into our mercy. indeed, they were of the righteous.
21|87|and [mention] the man of the fish, when he went off in anger and thought that We would not decre [anything] upon him. and he call out within the darknesses, "there is no deiti except you; exalt are you. indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers."
21|88|so We respond to him and save him from the distress. and thu do We save the believers.
21|89|and [mention] zechariah, when he call to hi lord, "mi lord, do not leav me alon [with no heir], while you are the best of inheritors."
21|90|so We respond to him, and We gave to him john, and amend for him hi wife. indeed, they use to hasten to good deed and supplic Us in hope and fear, and they were to Us humbl submissive.
21|91|and [mention] the one who guard her chastity, so We blew into her [garment] through our angel [gabriel], and We made her and her son a sign for the worlds.
21|92|inde this, your religion, is one religion, and I am your lord, so worship me.
21|93|and [yet] they divid their affair among themselves, [but] all to Us will return.
21|94|so whoever doe righteou deed while he is a believ - no denial will there be for hi effort, and inde we, of it, are recorders.
21|95|and there is prohibit upon [the peopl of] a citi which We have destroy that they will [ever] return
21|96|until when [the dam of] gog and magog ha been open and they, from everi elevation, descend
21|97|and [when] the true promis ha approached; then suddenli the eye of those who disbeliev will be stare [in horror, while they say], "O woe to us; we had been unmind of this; rather, we were wrongdoers."
21|98|indeed, you [disbelievers] and what you worship other than allah are the firewood of hell. you will be come to [enter] it.
21|99|had these [fals deities] been [actual] gods, they would not have come to it, but all are etern therein.
21|100|for them therein is heavi sighing, and they therein will not hear.
21|101|indeed, those for whom the best [reward] ha preced from Us - they are from it far removed.
21|102|they will not hear it sound, while they are, in that which their soul desire, abid eternally.
21|103|they will not be griev by the greatest terror, and the angel will meet them, [saying], "thi is your day which you have been promised" -
21|104|the day when We will fold the heaven like the fold of a [written] sheet for the records. As We began the first creation, We will repeat it. [that is] a promis bind upon us. indeed, We will do it.
21|105|and We have alreadi written in the book [of psalms] after the [previous] mention that the land [of paradise] is inherit by My righteou servants.
21|106|indeed, in thi [qur'an] is notif for a worship people.
21|107|and We have not sent you, [O muhammad], except as a merci to the worlds.
21|108|say, "it is onli reveal to me that your god is but one god; so will you be muslim [in submiss to him]?"
21|109|but if they turn away, then say, "I have announc to [all of] you equally. and I know not whether near or far is that which you are promised.
21|110|indeed, He know what is declar of speech, and He know what you conceal.
21|111|and I know not; perhap it is a trial for you and enjoy for a time."
21|112|[th prophet] ha said, "mi lord, judg [between us] in truth. and our lord is the most merciful, the one whose help is sought against that which you describe."
22|1|o mankind, fear your lord. indeed, the convuls of the [final] hour is a terribl thing.
22|2|on the day you see it everi nurs mother will be distract from that [child] she wa nursing, and everi pregnant woman will abort her pregnancy, and you will see the peopl [appearing] intox while they are not intoxicated; but the punish of allah is severe.
22|3|and of the peopl is he who disput about allah without knowledg and follow everi rebelli devil.
22|4|it ha been decre for everi devil that whoever turn to him - he will misguid him and will lead him to the punish of the blaze.
22|5|o people, if you should be in doubt about the resurrection, then [consid that] indeed, We creat you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a cling clot, and then from a lump of flesh, form and unform - that We may show you. and We settl in the womb whom We will for a specifi term, then We bring you out as a child, and then [we develop you] that you may reach your [time of] maturity. and among you is he who is taken in [early] death, and among you is he who is return to the most decrepit [old] age so that he knows, after [onc having] knowledge, nothing. and you see the earth barren, but when We send down upon it rain, it quiver and swell and grow [something] of everi beauti kind.
22|6|that is becaus allah is the truth and becaus He give life to the dead and becaus He is over all thing competent
22|7|and [that they may know] that the hour is come - no doubt about it - and that allah will resurrect those in the graves.
22|8|and of the peopl is he who disput about allah without knowledg or guidanc or an enlighten book [from him],
22|9|twist hi neck [in arrogance] to mislead [people] from the way of allah. for him in the world is disgrace, and We will make him tast on the day of resurrect the punish of the burn fire [while it is said],
22|10|"that is for what your hand have put forth and becaus allah is not ever unjust to [his] servants."
22|11|and of the peopl is he who worship allah on an edge. If he is touch by good, he is reassur by it; but if he is struck by trial, he turn on hi face [to the other direction]. He ha lost [this] world and the hereafter. that is what is the manifest loss.
22|12|h invok instead of allah that which neither harm him nor benefit him. that is what is the extrem error.
22|13|h invok one whose harm is closer than hi benefit - how wretch the protector and how wretch the associate.
22|14|indeed, allah will admit those who believ and do righteou deed to garden beneath which river flow. indeed, allah doe what He intends.
22|15|whoev should think that allah will not support [prophet muhammad] in thi world and the hereaft - let him extend a rope to the ceiling, then cut off [hi breath], and let him see: will hi effort remov that which enrag [him]?
22|16|and thu have We sent the qur'an down as vers of clear evid and becaus allah guid whom He intends.
22|17|indeed, those who have believ and those who were jew and the sabean and the christian and the magian and those who associ with allah - allah will judg between them on the day of resurrection. inde allah is, over all things, witness.
22|18|do you not see that to allah prostrat whoever is in the heaven and whoever is on the earth and the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the move creatur and mani of the people? but upon mani the punish ha been justified. and he whom allah humili - for him there is no bestow of honor. indeed, allah doe what He wills.
22|19|thes are two adversari who have disput over their lord. but those who disbeliev will have cut out for them garment of fire. pour upon their head will be scald water
22|20|bi which is melt that within their belli and [their] skins.
22|21|and for [striking] them are mace of iron.
22|22|everi time they want to get out of hellfir from anguish, they will be return to it, and [it will be said], "tast the punish of the burn fire!"
22|23|indeed, allah will admit those who believ and do righteou deed to garden beneath which river flow. they will be adorn therein with bracelet of gold and pearl, and their garment therein will be silk.
22|24|and they had been guid [in worldli life] to good speech, and they were guid to the path of the praiseworthy.
22|25|indeed, those who have disbeliev and avert [people] from the way of allah and [from] al-masjid al-haram, which We made for the peopl - equal are the resid therein and one from outside; and [also] whoever intend [a deed] therein of deviat [in religion] or wrongdo - We will make him tast of a pain punishment.
22|26|and [mention, O muhammad], when We design for abraham the site of the house, [saying], "do not associ anyth with Me and purifi My hous for those who perform tawaf and those who stand [in prayer] and those who bow and prostrate.
22|27|and proclaim to the peopl the hajj [pilgrimage]; they will come to you on foot and on everi lean camel; they will come from everi distant pass -
22|28|that they may wit benefit for themselv and mention the name of allah on known day over what He ha provid for them of [sacrificial] animals. So eat of them and feed the miser and poor.
22|29|then let them end their untidi and fulfil their vow and perform tawaf around the ancient house."
22|30|that [ha been commanded], and whoever honor the sacr ordin of allah - it is best for him in the sight of hi lord. and permit to you are the graze livestock, except what is recit to you. So avoid the uncleanli of idol and avoid fals statement,
22|31|inclin [only] to allah, not associ [anything] with him. and he who associ with allah - it is as though he had fallen from the sky and wa snatch by the bird or the wind carri him down into a remot place.
22|32|that [i so]. and whoever honor the symbol of allah - indeed, it is from the pieti of hearts.
22|33|for you the anim mark for sacrific are benefit for a specifi term; then their place of sacrific is at the ancient house.
22|34|and for all religion We have appoint a rite [of sacrifice] that they may mention the name of allah over what He ha provid for them of [sacrificial] animals. for your god is one god, so to him submit. and, [O muhammad], give good tide to the humbl [befor their lord]
22|35|who, when allah is mentioned, their heart are fearful, and [to] the patient over what ha afflict them, and the establish of prayer and those who spend from what We have provid them.
22|36|and the camel and cattl We have appoint for you as among the symbol of allah; for you therein is good. So mention the name of allah upon them when line up [for sacrifice]; and when they are [lifeless] on their sides, then eat from them and feed the needi and the beggar. thu have We subject them to you that you may be grateful.
22|37|their meat will not reach allah, nor will their blood, but what reach him is pieti from you. thu have We subject them to you that you may glorifi allah for that [to] which He ha guid you; and give good tide to the doer of good.
22|38|indeed, allah defend those who have believed. indeed, allah doe not like everyon treacher and ungrateful.
22|39|permiss [to fight] ha been given to those who are be fought, becaus they were wronged. and indeed, allah is compet to give them victory.
22|40|[they are] those who have been evict from their home without right - onli becaus they say, "our lord is allah." and were it not that allah check the people, some by mean of others, there would have been demolish monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosqu in which the name of allah is much mentioned. and allah will sure support those who support him. indeed, allah is power and exalt in might.
22|41|[and they are] those who, if We give them author in the land, establish prayer and give zakah and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong. and to allah belong the outcom of [all] matters.
22|42|and if they deni you, [O muhammad] - so, befor them, did the peopl of noah and 'aad and thamud deni [their prophets],
22|43|and the peopl of abraham and the peopl of lot
22|44|and the inhabit of madyan. and mose wa denied, so I prolong enjoy for the disbelievers; then I seiz them, and how [terrible] wa My reproach.
22|45|and how mani a citi did We destroy while it wa commit wrong - so it is [now] fallen into ruin - and [how many] an abandon well and [how many] a lofti palace.
22|46|so have they not travel through the earth and have heart by which to reason and ear by which to hear? for indeed, it is not eye that are blinded, but blind are the heart which are within the breasts.
22|47|and they urg you to hasten the punishment. but allah will never fail in hi promise. and indeed, a day with your lord is like a thousand year of those which you count.
22|48|and for how mani a citi did I prolong enjoy while it wa commit wrong. then I seiz it, and to Me is the [final] destination.
22|49|say, "O people, I am onli to you a clear warner."
22|50|and those who have believ and done righteou deed - for them is forgiv and nobl provision.
22|51|but the one who strove against our verses, [seeking] to caus failur - those are the companion of hellfire.
22|52|and We did not send befor you ani messeng or prophet except that when he spoke [or recited], satan threw into it [some misunderstanding]. but allah abolish that which satan throw in; then allah make precis hi verses. and allah is know and wise.
22|53|[that is] so He may make what satan throw in a trial for those within whose heart is diseas and those hard of heart. and indeed, the wrongdoer are in extrem dissension.
22|54|and so those who were given knowledg may know that it is the truth from your lord and [therefore] believ in it, and their heart humbl submit to it. and inde is allah the guid of those who have believ to a straight path.
22|55|but those who disbeliev will not ceas to be in doubt of it until the hour come upon them unexpectedli or there come to them the punish of a barren day.
22|56|[all] sovereignti that day is for allah; He will judg between them. So they who believ and did righteou deed will be in the garden of pleasure.
22|57|and they who disbeliev and deni our sign - for those there will be a humili punishment.
22|58|and those who emigr for the caus of allah and then were kill or die - allah will sure provid for them a good provision. and indeed, it is allah who is the best of providers.
22|59|h will sure caus them to enter an entranc with which they will be pleased, and indeed, allah is know and forbearing.
22|60|that [i so]. and whoever respond [to injustice] with the equival of that with which he wa harm and then is tyrann - allah will sure aid him. indeed, allah is pardon and forgiving.
22|61|that is becaus allah caus the night to enter the day and caus the day to enter the night and becaus allah is hear and seeing.
22|62|that is becaus allah is the truth, and that which they call upon other than him is falsehood, and becaus allah is the most high, the grand.
22|63|do you not see that allah ha sent down rain from the sky and the earth becom green? indeed, allah is subtl and acquainted.
22|64|to him belong what is in the heaven and what is on the earth. and indeed, allah is the free of need, the praiseworthy.
22|65|do you not see that allah ha subject to you whatev is on the earth and the ship which run through the sea by hi command? and He restrain the sky from fall upon the earth, unless by hi permission. inde allah, to the people, is kind and merciful.
22|66|and He is the one who gave you life; then He caus you to die and then will [again] give you life. indeed, mankind is ungrateful.
22|67|for everi religion We have appoint rite which they perform. so, [O muhammad], let the disbeliev not contend with you over the matter but invit them to your lord. indeed, you are upon straight guidance.
22|68|and if they disput with you, then say, "allah is most know of what you do.
22|69|allah will judg between you on the day of resurrect concern that over which you use to differ."
22|70|do you not know that allah know what is in the heaven and earth? indeed, that is in a record. inde that, for allah, is easy.
22|71|and they worship besid allah that for which He ha not sent down author and that of which they have no knowledge. and there will not be for the wrongdoer ani helper.
22|72|and when our vers are recit to them as clear evidences, you recogn in the face of those who disbeliev disapproval. they are almost on the verg of assault those who recit to them our verses. say, "then shall I inform you of [what is] wors than that? [it is] the fire which allah ha promis those who disbelieve, and wretch is the destination."
22|73|o people, an exampl is presented, so listen to it. indeed, those you invok besid allah will never creat [a much as] a fly, even if they gather togeth for that purpose. and if the fli should steal away from them a [tiny] thing, they could not recov it from him. weak are the pursuer and pursued.
22|74|they have not apprais allah with true appraisal. indeed, allah is power and exalt in might.
22|75|allah choos from the angel messeng and from the people. indeed, allah is hear and seeing.
22|76|h know what is [presently] befor them and what will be after them. and to allah will be return [all] matters.
22|77|o you who have believed, bow and prostrat and worship your lord and do good - that you may succeed.
22|78|and strive for allah with the strive due to him. He ha chosen you and ha not place upon you in the religion ani difficulty. [it is] the religion of your father, abraham. allah name you "muslims" befor [in former scriptures] and in thi [revelation] that the messeng may be a wit over you and you may be wit over the people. So establish prayer and give zakah and hold fast to allah. He is your protector; and excel is the protector, and excel is the helper.
23|1|certainli will the believ have succeeded:
23|2|they who are dure their prayer humbl submissive
23|3|and they who turn away from ill speech
23|4|and they who are observ of zakah
23|5|and they who guard their privat parts
23|6|except from their wive or those their right hand possess, for indeed, they will not be blame -
23|7|but whoever seek beyond that, then those are the transgressor -
23|8|and they who are to their trust and their promis attentive
23|9|and they who care maintain their prayer -
23|10|those are the inheritors
23|11|who will inherit al-firdaus. they will abid therein eternally.
23|12|and certainli did We creat man from an extract of clay.
23|13|then We place him as a sperm-drop in a firm lodging.
23|14|then We made the sperm-drop into a cling clot, and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the lump, bones, and We cover the bone with flesh; then We develop him into anoth creation. So bless is allah, the best of creators.
23|15|then indeed, after that you are to die.
23|16|then inde you, on the day of resurrection, will be resurrected.
23|17|and We have creat abov you seven layer heavens, and never have We been of [our] creation unaware.
23|18|and We have sent down rain from the sky in a measur amount and settl it in the earth. and indeed, We are abl to take it away.
23|19|and We brought forth for you therebi garden of palm tree and grapevin in which for you are abund fruit and from which you eat.
23|20|and [we brought forth] a tree issu from mount sinai which produc oil and food for those who eat.
23|21|and indeed, for you in livestock is a lesson. We give you drink from that which is in their bellies, and for you in them are numer benefits, and from them you eat.
23|22|and upon them and on ship you are carried.
23|23|and We had certainli sent noah to hi people, and he said, "O my people, worship allah; you have no deiti other than him; then will you not fear him?"
23|24|but the emin among those who disbeliev from hi peopl said, "thi is not but a man like yourselv who wish to take preced over you; and if allah had will [to send a messenger], He would have sent down angels. We have not heard of thi among our forefathers.
23|25|h is not but a man possess with madness, so wait concern him for a time."
23|26|[noah] said, "mi lord, support me becaus they have deni me."
23|27|so We inspir to him, "construct the ship under our observation, and our inspiration, and when our command come and the oven overflows, put into the ship from each [creature] two mate and your family, except those for whom the decre [of destruction] ha proceeded. and do not address Me concern those who have wronged; indeed, they are to be drowned.
23|28|and when you have board the ship, you and those with you, then say, 'prais to allah who ha save us from the wrongdo people.'
23|29|and say, 'mi lord, let me land at a bless land place, and you are the best to accommod [us].' "
23|30|inde in that are signs, and indeed, We are ever test [our servants].
23|31|then We produc after them a gener of others.
23|32|and We sent among them a messeng from themselves, [saying], "worship allah; you have no deiti other than him; then will you not fear him?"
23|33|and the emin among hi peopl who disbeliev and deni the meet of the hereaft while We had given them luxuri in the worldli life said, "thi is not but a man like yourselves. He eat of that from which you eat and drink of what you drink.
23|34|and if you should obey a man like yourselves, indeed, you would then be losers.
23|35|do he promis you that when you have die and becom dust and bone that you will be brought forth [onc more]?
23|36|how far, how far, is that which you are promised.
23|37|lif is not but our worldli life - we die and live, but we will not be resurrected.
23|38|h is not but a man who ha invent a lie about allah, and we will not believ him."
23|39|h said, "mi lord, support me becaus they have deni me."
23|40|[allah] said, "after a little, they will sure becom regretful."
23|41|so the shriek seiz them in truth, and We made them as [plant] stubble. then away with the wrongdo people.
23|42|then We produc after them other generations.
23|43|no nation will preced it time [of termination], nor will they remain [thereafter].
23|44|then We sent our messeng in succession. everi time there came to a nation it messenger, they deni him, so We made them follow one anoth [to destruction], and We made them narrations. So away with a peopl who do not believe.
23|45|then We sent mose and hi brother aaron with our sign and a clear authority
23|46|to pharaoh and hi establishment, but they were arrog and were a haughti people.
23|47|they said, "should we believ two men like ourselv while their peopl are for us in servitude?"
23|48|so they deni them and were of those destroyed.
23|49|and We certainli gave mose the scriptur that perhap they would be guided.
23|50|and We made the son of mari and hi mother a sign and shelter them within a high ground have level [areas] and flow water.
23|51|[allah said], "O messengers, eat from the good food and work righteousness. indeed, I, of what you do, am knowing.
23|52|and inde this, your religion, is one religion, and I am your lord, so fear me."
23|53|but the peopl divid their religion among them into sect - each faction, in what it has, rejoicing.
23|54|so leav them in their confus for a time.
23|55|do they think that what We extend to them of wealth and children
23|56|i [because] We hasten for them good things? rather, they do not perceive.
23|57|indeed, they who are apprehens from fear of their lord
23|58|and they who believ in the sign of their lord
23|59|and they who do not associ anyth with their lord
23|60|and they who give what they give while their heart are fear becaus they will be return to their lord -
23|61|it is those who hasten to good deeds, and they outstrip [others] therein.
23|62|and We charg no soul except [with that within] it capacity, and with Us is a record which speak with truth; and they will not be wronged.
23|63|but their heart are cover with confus over this, and they have [evil] deed besid disbelief which they are doing,
23|64|until when We seiz their affluent one with punishment, at onc they are cri [to allah] for help.
23|65|do not cri out today. indeed, by Us you will not be helped.
23|66|mi vers had alreadi been recit to you, but you were turn back on your heels
23|67|in arrog regard it, convers by night, speak evil.
23|68|then have they not reflect over the qur'an, or ha there come to them that which had not come to their forefathers?
23|69|or did they not know their messenger, so they are toward him disacknowledging?
23|70|or do they say, "in him is madness?" rather, he brought them the truth, but most of them, to the truth, are averse.
23|71|but if the truth had follow their inclinations, the heaven and the earth and whoever is in them would have been ruined. rather, We have brought them their message, but they, from their message, are turn away.
23|72|or do you, [O muhammad], ask them for payment? but the reward of your lord is best, and He is the best of providers.
23|73|and indeed, you invit them to a straight path.
23|74|but indeed, those who do not believ in the hereaft are deviat from the path.
23|75|and even if We gave them merci and remov what wa upon them of affliction, they would persist in their transgression, wander blindly.
23|76|and We had grip them with suffer [a a warning], but they did not yield to their lord, nor did they humbl supplicate, [and will continu thus]
23|77|until when We have open befor them a door of sever punishment, immedi they will be therein in despair.
23|78|and it is He who produc for you hear and vision and hearts; littl are you grateful.
23|79|and it is He who ha multipli you throughout the earth, and to him you will be gathered.
23|80|and it is He who give life and caus death, and hi is the altern of the night and the day. then will you not reason?
23|81|rather, they say like what the former peopl said.
23|82|they said, "when we have die and becom dust and bones, are we inde to be resurrected?
23|83|w have been promis this, we and our forefathers, before; thi is not but legend of the former peoples."
23|84|say, [O muhammad], "to whom belong the earth and whoever is in it, if you should know?"
23|85|they will say, "to allah." say, "then will you not remember?"
23|86|say, "who is lord of the seven heaven and lord of the great throne?"
23|87|they will say, "[they belong] to allah." say, "then will you not fear him?"
23|88|say, "in whose hand is the realm of all thing - and He protect while none can protect against him - if you should know?"
23|89|they will say, "[all belongs] to allah." say, "then how are you deluded?"
23|90|rather, We have brought them the truth, and inde they are liars.
23|91|allah ha not taken ani son, nor ha there ever been with him ani deity. [if there had been], then each deiti would have taken what it created, and some of them would have sought to overcom others. exalt is allah abov what they describ [concern him].
23|92|[h is] knower of the unseen and the witnessed, so high is He abov what they associ [with him].
23|93|say, [O muhammad], "mi lord, if you should show me that which they are promised,
23|94|mi lord, then do not place me among the wrongdo people."
23|95|and indeed, We are abl to show you what We have promis them.
23|96|repel, by [mean of] what is best, [their] evil. We are most know of what they describe.
23|97|and say, "mi lord, I seek refug in you from the incit of the devils,
23|98|and I seek refug in you, my lord, lest they be present with me."
23|99|[for such is the state of the disbelievers], until, when death come to one of them, he says, "mi lord, send me back
23|100|that I might do righteous in that which I left behind." no! It is onli a word he is saying; and behind them is a barrier until the day they are resurrected.
23|101|so when the horn is blown, no relationship will there be among them that day, nor will they ask about one another.
23|102|and those whose scale are heavi [with good deeds] - it is they who are the successful.
23|103|but those whose scale are light - those are the one who have lost their souls, [being] in hell, abid eternally.
23|104|th fire will sear their faces, and they therein will have taut smiles.
23|105|[it will be said]. "were not My vers recit to you and you use to deni them?"
23|106|they will say, "our lord, our wretched overcam us, and we were a peopl astray.
23|107|our lord, remov us from it, and if we were to return [to evil], we would inde be wrongdoers."
23|108|h will say, "remain despis therein and do not speak to me.
23|109|indeed, there wa a parti of My servant who said, 'our lord, we have believed, so forgiv us and have merci upon us, and you are the best of the merciful.'
23|110|but you took them in mockeri to the point that they made you forget My remembrance, and you use to laugh at them.
23|111|indeed, I have reward them thi day for their patient endur - that they are the attain [of success]."
23|112|[allah] will say, "how long did you remain on earth in number of years?"
23|113|they will say, "we remain a day or part of a day; ask those who enumerate."
23|114|h will say, "you stay not but a littl - if onli you had known.
23|115|then did you think that We creat you uselessli and that to Us you would not be returned?"
23|116|so exalt is allah, the sovereign, the truth; there is no deiti except him, lord of the nobl throne.
23|117|and whoever invok besid allah anoth deiti for which he ha no proof - then hi account is onli with hi lord. indeed, the disbeliev will not succeed.
23|118|and, [O muhammad], say, "mi lord, forgiv and have mercy, and you are the best of the merciful."
24|1|[thi is] a surah which We have sent down and made [that within it] obligatori and reveal therein vers of clear evid that you might remember.
24|2|th [unmarried] woman or [unmarried] man found guilti of sexual intercours - lash each one of them with a hundr lashes, and do not be taken by piti for them in the religion of allah, if you should believ in allah and the last day. and let a group of the believ wit their punishment.
24|3|th fornic doe not marri except a [female] fornic or polytheist, and none marri her except a fornic or a polytheist, and that ha been made unlaw to the believers.
24|4|and those who accus chast women and then do not produc four wit - lash them with eighti lash and do not accept from them testimoni ever after. and those are the defiantli disobedient,
24|5|except for those who repent thereaft and reform, for indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
24|6|and those who accus their wive [of adultery] and have no wit except themselv - then the wit of one of them [shall be] four testimoni [swearing] by allah that indeed, he is of the truthful.
24|7|and the fifth [oath will be] that the curs of allah be upon him if he should be among the liars.
24|8|but it will prevent punish from her if she give four testimoni [swearing] by allah that indeed, he is of the liars.
24|9|and the fifth [oath will be] that the wrath of allah be upon her if he wa of the truthful.
24|10|and if not for the favor of allah upon you and hi mercy... and becaus allah is accept of repent and wise.
24|11|indeed, those who came with falsehood are a group among you. Do not think it bad for you; rather it is good for you. for everi person among them is what [punishment] he ha earn from the sin, and he who took upon himself the greater portion thereof - for him is a great punishment.
24|12|why, when you heard it, did not the believ men and believ women think good of one anoth and say, "thi is an obviou falsehood"?
24|13|whi did they [who slandered] not produc for it four witnesses? and when they do not produc the witnesses, then it is they, in the sight of allah, who are the liars.
24|14|and if it had not been for the favor of allah upon you and hi merci in thi world and the hereafter, you would have been touch for that [lie] in which you were involv by a great punishment
24|15|when you receiv it with your tongu and said with your mouth that of which you had no knowledg and thought it wa insignific while it was, in the sight of allah, tremendous.
24|16|and why, when you heard it, did you not say, "it is not for us to speak of this. exalt are you, [O allah]; thi is a great slander"?
24|17|allah warn you against return to the like of thi [conduct], ever, if you should be believers.
24|18|and allah make clear to you the verses, and allah is know and wise.
24|19|indeed, those who like that immor should be spread [or publicized] among those who have believ will have a pain punish in thi world and the hereafter. and allah know and you do not know.
24|20|and if it had not been for the favor of allah upon you and hi mercy... and becaus allah is kind and merciful.
24|21|o you who have believed, do not follow the footstep of satan. and whoever follow the footstep of satan - indeed, he enjoin immor and wrongdoing. and if not for the favor of allah upon you and hi mercy, not one of you would have been pure, ever, but allah purifi whom He wills, and allah is hear and knowing.
24|22|and let not those of virtu among you and wealth swear not to give [aid] to their rel and the needi and the emigr for the caus of allah, and let them pardon and overlook. would you not like that allah should forgiv you? and allah is forgiv and merciful.
24|23|indeed, those who [falsely] accus chaste, unawar and believ women are curs in thi world and the hereafter; and they will have a great punishment
24|24|on a day when their tongues, their hand and their feet will bear wit against them as to what they use to do.
24|25|that day, allah will pay them in full their deserv recompense, and they will know that it is allah who is the perfect in justice.
24|26|evil word are for evil men, and evil men are [subjected] to evil words. and good word are for good men, and good men are [an object] of good words. those [good people] are declar innoc of what the slander say. for them is forgiv and nobl provision.
24|27|o you who have believed, do not enter hous other than your own hous until you ascertain welcom and greet their inhabitants. that is best for you; perhap you will be reminded.
24|28|and if you do not find anyon therein, do not enter them until permiss ha been given you. and if it is said to you, "go back," then go back; it is purer for you. and allah is know of what you do.
24|29|ther is no blame upon you for enter hous not inhabit in which there is conveni for you. and allah know what you reveal and what you conceal.
24|30|tel the believ men to reduc [some] of their vision and guard their privat parts. that is purer for them. indeed, allah is acquaint with what they do.
24|31|and tell the believ women to reduc [some] of their vision and guard their privat part and not expos their adorn except that which [necessarily] appear thereof and to wrap [a portion of] their headcov over their chest and not expos their adorn except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, that which their right hand possess, or those male attend have no physic desire, or children who are not yet awar of the privat aspect of women. and let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment. and turn to allah in repentance, all of you, O believers, that you might succeed.
24|32|and marri the unmarri among you and the righteou among your male slave and femal slaves. If they should be poor, allah will enrich them from hi bounty, and allah is all-encompass and knowing.
24|33|but let them who find not [the mean for] marriag abstain [from sexual relations] until allah enrich them from hi bounty. and those who seek a contract [for eventu emancipation] from among whom your right hand possess - then make a contract with them if you know there is within them good and give them from the wealth of allah which He ha given you. and do not compel your slave girl to prostitution, if they desir chastity, to seek [thereby] the temporari interest of worldli life. and if someon should compel them, then indeed, allah is [to them], after their compulsion, forgiv and merciful.
24|34|and We have certainli sent down to you distinct vers and exampl from those who pass on befor you and an admonit for those who fear allah.
24|35|allah is the light of the heaven and the earth. the exampl of hi light is like a nich within which is a lamp, the lamp is within glass, the glass as if it were a pearli [white] star lit from [the oil of] a bless oliv tree, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil would almost glow even if untouch by fire. light upon light. allah guid to hi light whom He wills. and allah present exampl for the people, and allah is know of all things.
24|36|[such nich are] in mosqu which allah ha order to be rais and that hi name be mention therein; exalt him within them in the morn and the evenings
24|37|[are] men whom neither commerc nor sale distract from the remembr of allah and perform of prayer and give of zakah. they fear a day in which the heart and eye will [fearfully] turn about -
24|38|that allah may reward them [accord to] the best of what they did and increas them from hi bounty. and allah give provis to whom He will without account.
24|39|but those who disbeliev - their deed are like a mirag in a lowland which a thirsti one think is water until, when he come to it, he find it is noth but find allah befor him, and He will pay him in full hi due; and allah is swift in account.
24|40|or [they are] like dark within an unfathom sea which is cover by waves, upon which are waves, over which are cloud - darknesses, some of them upon others. when one put out hi hand [therein], he can hardli see it. and he to whom allah ha not grant light - for him there is no light.
24|41|do you not see that allah is exalt by whomev is within the heaven and the earth and [by] the bird with wing spread [in flight]? each [of them] ha known hi [mean of] prayer and exalt [him], and allah is know of what they do.
24|42|and to allah belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth, and to allah is the destination.
24|43|do you not see that allah drive clouds? then He bring them together, then He make them into a mass, and you see the rain emerg from within it. and He send down from the sky, mountain [of clouds] within which is hail, and He strike with it whom He will and avert it from whom He wills. the flash of it lighten almost take away the eyesight.
24|44|allah altern the night and the day. inde in that is a lesson for those who have vision.
24|45|allah ha creat everi [living] creatur from water. and of them are those that move on their bellies, and of them are those that walk on two legs, and of them are those that walk on four. allah creat what He wills. indeed, allah is over all thing competent.
24|46|w have certainli sent down distinct verses. and allah guid whom He will to a straight path.
24|47|but the hypocrit say, "we have believ in allah and in the messenger, and we obey"; then a parti of them turn away after that. and those are not believers.
24|48|and when they are call to [the word of] allah and hi messeng to judg between them, at onc a parti of them turn asid [in refusal].
24|49|but if the right is theirs, they come to him in prompt obedience.
24|50|i there diseas in their hearts? Or have they doubted? Or do they fear that allah will be unjust to them, or hi messenger? rather, it is they who are the wrongdoers.
24|51|th onli statement of the [true] believ when they are call to allah and hi messeng to judg between them is that they say, "we hear and we obey." and those are the successful.
24|52|and whoever obey allah and hi messeng and fear allah and is consciou of him - it is those who are the attainers.
24|53|and they swear by allah their strongest oath that if you order them, they would go forth [in allah 's cause]. say, "do not swear. [such] obedi is known. indeed, allah is acquaint with that which you do."
24|54|say, "obey allah and obey the messenger; but if you turn away - then upon him is onli that [duty] with which he ha been charged, and upon you is that with which you have been charged. and if you obey him, you will be [rightly] guided. and there is not upon the messeng except the [respons for] clear notification."
24|55|allah ha promis those who have believ among you and done righteou deed that He will sure grant them success [to authority] upon the earth just as He grant it to those befor them and that He will sure establish for them [therein] their religion which He ha prefer for them and that He will sure substitut for them, after their fear, security, [for] they worship me, not associ anyth with me. but whoever disbeliev after that - then those are the defiantli disobedient.
24|56|and establish prayer and give zakah and obey the messeng - that you may receiv mercy.
24|57|nev think that the disbeliev are caus failur [to allah] upon the earth. their refug will be the fire - and how wretch the destination.
24|58|o you who have believed, let those whom your right hand possess and those who have not [yet] reach puberti among you ask permiss of you [befor entering] at three times: befor the dawn prayer and when you put asid your cloth [for rest] at noon and after the night prayer. [these are] three time of privaci for you. there is no blame upon you nor upon them beyond these [periods], for they continu circul among you - some of you, among others. thu doe allah make clear to you the verses; and allah is know and wise.
24|59|and when the children among you reach puberty, let them ask permiss [at all times] as those befor them have done. thu doe allah make clear to you hi verses; and allah is know and wise.
24|60|and women of post-menstru age who have no desir for marriag - there is no blame upon them for put asid their outer garment [but] not display adornment. but to modestli refrain [from that] is better for them. and allah is hear and knowing.
24|61|ther is not upon the blind [any] constraint nor upon the lame constraint nor upon the ill constraint nor upon yourselv when you eat from your [own] hous or the hous of your father or the hous of your mother or the hous of your brother or the hous of your sister or the hous of your father' brother or the hous of your father' sister or the hous of your mother' brother or the hous of your mother' sister or [from houses] whose key you possess or [from the house] of your friend. there is no blame upon you whether you eat togeth or separately. but when you enter houses, give greet of peac upon each other - a greet from allah, bless and good. thu doe allah make clear to you the vers [of ordinance] that you may understand.
24|62|th believ are onli those who believ in allah and hi messeng and, when they are [meeting] with him for a matter of common interest, do not depart until they have ask hi permission. indeed, those who ask your permission, [O muhammad] - those are the one who believ in allah and hi messenger. So when they ask your permiss for someth of their affairs, then give permiss to whom you will among them and ask forgiv for them of allah. indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
24|63|do not make [your] call of the messeng among yourselv as the call of one of you to another. alreadi allah know those of you who slip away, conceal by others. So let those bewar who dissent from the prophet' order, lest fitnah strike them or a pain punishment.
24|64|unquestionably, to allah belong whatev is in the heaven and earth. alreadi He know that upon which you [stand] and [knows] the day when they will be return to him and He will inform them of what they have done. and allah is know of all things.
25|1|bless is He who sent down the criterion upon hi servant that he may be to the world a warner -
25|2|he to whom belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth and who ha not taken a son and ha not had a partner in dominion and ha creat each thing and determin it with [precise] determination.
25|3|but they have taken besid him god which creat nothing, while they are created, and possess not for themselv ani harm or benefit and possess not [power to cause] death or life or resurrection.
25|4|and those who disbeliev say, "thi [qur'an] is not except a falsehood he invented, and anoth peopl assist him in it." but they have commit an injustic and a lie.
25|5|and they say, "legend of the former peopl which he ha written down, and they are dictat to him morn and afternoon."
25|6|say, [O muhammad], "it ha been reveal by He who know [every] secret within the heaven and the earth. indeed, He is ever forgiv and merciful."
25|7|and they say, "what is thi messeng that eat food and walk in the markets? whi wa there not sent down to him an angel so he would be with him a warner?
25|8|or [whi is not] a treasur present to him [from heaven], or doe he [not] have a garden from which he eats?" and the wrongdoer say, "you follow not but a man affect by magic."
25|9|look how they strike for you comparisons; but they have strayed, so they cannot [find] a way.
25|10|bless is He who, if He willed, could have made for you [something] better than that - garden beneath which river flow - and could make for you palaces.

25|18|they will say, "exalt are you! It wa not for us to take besid you ani allies. but you provid comfort for them and their father until they forgot the messag and becam a peopl ruined."
25|19|so they will deni you, [disbelievers], in what you say, and you cannot avert [punishment] or [find] help. and whoever commit injustic among you - We will make him tast a great punishment.
25|20|and We did not send befor you, [O muhammad], ani of the messeng except that they ate food and walk in the markets. and We have made some of you [people] as trial for other - will you have patience? and ever is your lord, seeing.

25|28|oh, woe to me! I wish I had not taken that one as a friend.
25|29|h led me away from the remembr after it had come to me. and ever is satan, to man, a deserter."

25|42|h almost would have misl us from our god had we not been steadfast in [worship of] them." but they are go to know, when they see the punishment, who is farthest astray in [his] way.
25|43|hav you seen the one who take as hi god hi own desire? then would you be respons for him?
25|44|or do you think that most of them hear or reason? they are not except like livestock. rather, they are [even] more astray in [their] way.
25|45|hav you not consid your lord - how He extend the shadow, and if He willed, He could have made it stationary? then We made the sun for it an indication.

25|51|and if We had willed, We could have sent into everi citi a warner.
25|52|so do not obey the disbelievers, and strive against them with the qur'an a great striving.

25|61|bless is He who ha place in the sky great star and place therein a [burning] lamp and lumin moon.
25|62|and it is He who ha made the night and the day in success for whoever desir to rememb or desir gratitude.

25|65|and those who say, "our lord, avert from us the punish of hell. indeed, it punish is ever adhering;
25|66|indeed, it is evil as a settlement and residence."
25|67|and [they are] those who, when they spend, do so not excess or sparingli but are ever, between that, [justly] moderate
25|68|and those who do not invok with allah anoth deiti or kill the soul which allah ha forbidden [to be killed], except by right, and do not commit unlaw sexual intercourse. and whoever should do that will meet a penalty.

26|2|thes are the vers of the clear book.
26|3|perhaps, [O muhammad], you would kill yourself with grief that they will not be believers.
26|4|if We willed, We could send down to them from the sky a sign for which their neck would remain humbled.
26|5|and no revel come to them anew from the most merci except that they turn away from it.
26|6|for they have alreadi denied, but there will come to them the news of that which they use to ridicule.
26|7|did they not look at the earth - how much We have produc therein from everi nobl kind?

26|10|and [mention] when your lord call moses, [saying], "go to the wrongdo peopl -
26|11|the peopl of pharaoh. will they not fear allah?"
26|12|h said, "mi lord, inde I fear that they will deni me
26|13|and that my breast will tighten and my tongu will not be fluent, so send for aaron.
26|14|and they have upon me a [claim due to] sin, so I fear that they will kill me."
26|15|[allah] said, "no. Go both of you with our signs; indeed, We are with you, listening.
26|16|go to pharaoh and say, 'we are the messeng of the lord of the worlds,
26|17|[command to say], "send with us the children of israel."'"
26|18|[pharaoh] said, "did we not rais you among us as a child, and you remain among us for year of your life?
26|19|and [then] you did your deed which you did, and you were of the ungrateful."
26|20|[moses] said, "I did it, then, while I wa of those astray.
26|21|so I fled from you when I fear you. then my lord grant me wisdom and prophethood and appoint me [a one] of the messengers.
26|22|and is thi a favor of which you remind me - that you have enslav the children of israel?"
26|23|said pharaoh, "and what is the lord of the worlds?"
26|24|[moses] said, "the lord of the heaven and earth and that between them, if you should be convinced."
26|25|[pharaoh] said to those around him, "do you not hear?"
26|26|[moses] said, "your lord and the lord of your first forefathers."
26|27|[pharaoh] said, "indeed, your 'messenger' who ha been sent to you is mad."
26|28|[moses] said, "lord of the east and the west and that between them, if you were to reason."
26|29|[pharaoh] said, "if you take a god other than me, I will sure place you among those imprisoned."
26|30|[moses] said, "even if I brought you proof manifest?"
26|31|[pharaoh] said, "then bring it, if you should be of the truthful."
26|32|so [moses] threw hi staff, and suddenli it wa a serpent manifest.
26|33|and he drew out hi hand; thereupon it wa white for the observers.
26|34|[pharaoh] said to the emin one around him, "indeed, thi is a learn magician.
26|35|h want to drive you out of your land by hi magic, so what do you advise?"
26|36|they said, "postpon [the matter of] him and hi brother and send among the citi gatherers
26|37|who will bring you everi learned, skill magician."
26|38|so the magician were assembl for the appoint of a well-known day.
26|39|and it wa said to the people, "will you congregate
26|40|that we might follow the magician if they are the predominant?"
26|41|and when the magician arrived, they said to pharaoh, "i there inde for us a reward if we are the predominant?"
26|42|h said, "yes, and indeed, you will then be of those near [to me]."
26|43|mos said to them, "throw whatev you will throw."
26|44|so they threw their rope and their staff and said, "bi the might of pharaoh, inde it is we who are predominant."
26|45|then mose threw hi staff, and at onc it devour what they falsified.
26|46|so the magician fell down in prostrat [to allah].
26|47|they said, "we have believ in the lord of the worlds,
26|48|th lord of mose and aaron."
26|49|[pharaoh] said, "you believ mose befor I gave you permission. indeed, he is your leader who ha taught you magic, but you are go to know. I will sure cut off your hand and your feet on opposit sides, and I will sure crucifi you all."
26|50|they said, "no harm. indeed, to our lord we will return.
26|51|indeed, we aspir that our lord will forgiv us our sin becaus we were the first of the believers."
26|52|and We inspir to moses, "travel by night with My servants; indeed, you will be pursued."
26|53|then pharaoh sent among the citi gatherers
26|54|[and said], "indeed, those are but a small band,
26|55|and indeed, they are enrag us,
26|56|and indeed, we are a cautiou society... "
26|57|so We remov them from garden and springs
26|58|and treasur and honor station -
26|59|thus. and We caus to inherit it the children of israel.
26|60|so they pursu them at sunrise.
26|61|and when the two compani saw one another, the companion of mose said, "indeed, we are to be overtaken!"
26|62|[moses] said, "no! indeed, with me is my lord; He will guid me."
26|63|then We inspir to moses, "strike with your staff the sea," and it parted, and each portion wa like a great tower mountain.
26|64|and We advanc thereto the pursuers.
26|65|and We save mose and those with him, all together.
26|66|then We drown the others.
26|67|inde in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.
26|68|and indeed, your lord - He is the exalt in might, the merciful.
26|69|and recit to them the news of abraham,
26|70|when he said to hi father and hi people, "what do you worship?"
26|71|they said, "we worship idol and remain to them devoted."
26|72|h said, "do they hear you when you supplicate?
26|73|or do they benefit you, or do they harm?"
26|74|they said, "but we found our father do thus."
26|75|h said, "then do you see what you have been worshipping,
26|76|y and your ancient forefathers?
26|77|indeed, they are enemi to me, except the lord of the worlds,
26|78|who creat me, and He [it is who] guid me.
26|79|and it is He who feed me and give me drink.
26|80|and when I am ill, it is He who cure me
26|81|and who will caus me to die and then bring me to life
26|82|and who I aspir that He will forgiv me my sin on the day of recompense."
26|83|[and he said], "mi lord, grant me author and join me with the righteous.
26|84|and grant me a reput of honor among later generations.
26|85|and place me among the inheritor of the garden of pleasure.
26|86|and forgiv my father. indeed, he ha been of those astray.
26|87|and do not disgrac me on the day they are [all] resurrect -
26|88|the day when there will not benefit [anyone] wealth or children
26|89|but onli one who come to allah with a sound heart."
26|90|and paradis will be brought near [that day] to the righteous.
26|91|and hellfir will be brought forth for the deviators,

26|225|do you not see that in everi valley they roam
26|226|and that they say what they do not do? -
26|227|except those [poets] who believ and do righteou deed and rememb allah often and defend [the muslims] after they were wronged. and those who have wrong are go to know to what [kind of] return they will be returned.
27|1|ta, seen. these are the vers of the qur'an and a clear book
27|2|a guidanc and good tide for the believers
27|3|who establish prayer and give zakah, and of the hereaft they are certain [in faith].
27|4|indeed, for those who do not believ in the hereafter, We have made pleas to them their deeds, so they wander blindly.
27|5|thos are the one for whom there will be the worst of punishment, and in the hereaft they are the greatest losers.
27|6|and indeed, [O muhammad], you receiv the qur'an from one wise and knowing.
27|7|[mention] when mose said to hi family, "indeed, I have perceiv a fire. I will bring you from there inform or will bring you a burn torch that you may warm yourselves."
27|8|but when he came to it, he wa called, "bless is whoever is at the fire and whoever is around it. and exalt is allah, lord of the worlds.
27|9|o moses, inde it is I - allah, the exalt in might, the wise."
27|10|and [he wa told], "throw down your staff." but when he saw it writh as if it were a snake, he turn in flight and did not return. [allah said], "O moses, fear not. indeed, in My presenc the messeng do not fear.
27|11|otherwise, he who wrongs, then substitut good after evil - indeed, I am forgiv and merciful.
27|12|and put your hand into the open of your garment [at the breast]; it will come out white without disease. [these are] among the nine sign [you will take] to pharaoh and hi people. indeed, they have been a peopl defiantli disobedient."
27|13|but when there came to them our visibl signs, they said, "thi is obviou magic."
27|14|and they reject them, while their [inner] selv were convinc thereof, out of injustic and haughtiness. So see how wa the end of the corrupters.
27|15|and We had certainli given to david and solomon knowledge, and they said, "prais [i due] to allah, who ha favor us over mani of hi believ servants."
27|16|and solomon inherit david. He said, "O people, we have been taught the languag of birds, and we have been given from all things. indeed, thi is evid bounty."
27|17|and gather for solomon were hi soldier of the jinn and men and birds, and they were [marching] in rows.
27|18|until, when they came upon the valley of the ants, an ant said, "O ants, enter your dwell that you not be crush by solomon and hi soldier while they perceiv not."
27|19|so [solomon] smiled, amus at her speech, and said, "mi lord, enabl me to be grate for your favor which you have bestow upon me and upon my parent and to do righteous of which you approve. and admit me by your merci into [the rank of] your righteou servants."
27|20|and he took attend of the bird and said, "whi do I not see the hoopo - or is he among the absent?
27|21|i will sure punish him with a sever punish or slaughter him unless he bring me clear authorization."
27|22|but the hoopo stay not long and said, "I have encompass [in knowledge] that which you have not encompassed, and I have come to you from sheba with certain news.
27|23|indeed, I found [there] a woman rule them, and she ha been given of all things, and she ha a great throne.
27|24|i found her and her peopl prostrat to the sun instead of allah, and satan ha made their deed pleas to them and avert them from [his] way, so they are not guided,
27|25|[and] so they do not prostrat to allah, who bring forth what is hidden within the heaven and the earth and know what you conceal and what you declar -
27|26|allah - there is no deiti except him, lord of the great throne."
27|27|[solomon] said, "we will see whether you were truth or were of the liars.
27|28|tak thi letter of mine and deliv it to them. then leav them and see what [answer] they will return."
27|29|sh said, "O emin ones, indeed, to me ha been deliv a nobl letter.
27|30|indeed, it is from solomon, and indeed, it reads: 'in the name of allah, the entir merciful, the especi merciful,
27|31|b not haughti with me but come to me in submiss [a muslims].' "
27|32|she said, "O emin ones, advis me in my affair. I would not decid a matter until you wit [for] me."
27|33|they said, "we are men of strength and of great militari might, but the command is yours, so see what you will command."
27|34|sh said, "inde king - when they enter a city, they ruin it and render the honor of it peopl humbled. and thu do they do.
27|35|but indeed, I will send to them a gift and see with what [reply] the messeng will return."
27|36|so when they came to solomon, he said, "do you provid me with wealth? but what allah ha given me is better than what He ha given you. rather, it is you who rejoic in your gift.
27|37|return to them, for we will sure come to them with soldier that they will be powerless to encounter, and we will sure expel them therefrom in humiliation, and they will be debased."
27|38|[solomon] said, "O assembl [of jinn], which of you will bring me her throne befor they come to me in submission?"
27|39|a power one from among the jinn said, "I will bring it to you befor you rise from your place, and indeed, I am for thi [task] strong and trustworthy."
27|40|said one who had knowledg from the scripture, "I will bring it to you befor your glanc return to you." and when [solomon] saw it place befor him, he said, "thi is from the favor of my lord to test me whether I will be grate or ungrateful. and whoever is grate - hi gratitud is onli for [the benefit of] himself. and whoever is ungrat - then indeed, my lord is free of need and generous."
27|41|h said, "disguis for her her throne; we will see whether she will be guid [to truth] or will be of those who is not guided."
27|42|so when she arrived, it wa said [to her], "i your throne like this?" she said, "[it is] as though it wa it." [solomon said], "and we were given knowledg befor her, and we have been muslim [in submiss to allah].
27|43|and that which she wa worship other than allah had avert her [from submiss to him]. indeed, she wa from a disbeliev people."
27|44|sh wa told, "enter the palace." but when she saw it, she thought it wa a bodi of water and uncov her shin [to wade through]. He said, "indeed, it is a palac [whose floor is] made smooth with glass." she said, "mi lord, inde I have wrong myself, and I submit with solomon to allah, lord of the worlds."
27|45|and We had certainli sent to thamud their brother salih, [saying], "worship allah," and at onc they were two parti conflicting.
27|46|h said, "O my people, whi are you impati for evil instead of good? whi do you not seek forgiv of allah that you may receiv mercy?"
27|47|they said, "we consid you a bad omen, you and those with you." He said, "your omen is with allah. rather, you are a peopl be tested."
27|48|and there were in the citi nine famili head caus corrupt in the land and not amend [it affairs].
27|49|they said, "take a mutual oath by allah that we will kill him by night, he and hi family. then we will say to hi executor, 'we did not wit the destruct of hi family, and indeed, we are truthful.' "
27|50|and they plan a plan, and We plan a plan, while they perceiv not.
27|51|then look how wa the outcom of their plan - that We destroy them and their people, all.
27|52|so those are their houses, desol becaus of the wrong they had done. inde in that is a sign for peopl who know.
27|53|and We save those who believ and use to fear allah.
27|54|and [mention] lot, when he said to hi people, "do you commit immor while you are seeing?
27|55|do you inde approach men with desir instead of women? rather, you are a peopl behav ignorantly."
27|56|but the answer of hi peopl wa not except that they said, "expel the famili of lot from your city. indeed, they are peopl who keep themselv pure."
27|57|so We save him and hi family, except for hi wife; We destin her to be of those who remain behind.
27|58|and We rain upon them a rain [of stones], and evil wa the rain of those who were warned.
27|59|say, [O muhammad], "prais be to allah, and peac upon hi servant whom He ha chosen. Is allah better or what they associ with him?"
27|60|[mor precisely], is He [not best] who creat the heaven and the earth and sent down for you rain from the sky, caus to grow therebi garden of joy beauti which you could not [otherwise] have grown the tree thereof? Is there a deiti with allah? [no], but they are a peopl who ascrib equal [to him].
27|61|i He [not best] who made the earth a stabl ground and place within it river and made for it firmli set mountain and place between the two sea a barrier? Is there a deiti with allah? [no], but most of them do not know.
27|62|i He [not best] who respond to the desper one when he call upon him and remov evil and make you inheritor of the earth? Is there a deiti with allah? littl do you remember.
27|63|i He [not best] who guid you through the dark of the land and sea and who send the wind as good tide befor hi mercy? Is there a deiti with allah? high is allah abov whatev they associ with him.
27|64|i He [not best] who begin creation and then repeat it and who provid for you from the heaven and earth? Is there a deiti with allah? say, "produc your proof, if you should be truthful."
27|65|say, "none in the heaven and earth know the unseen except allah, and they do not perceiv when they will be resurrected."
27|66|rather, their knowledg is arrest concern the hereafter. rather, they are in doubt about it. rather, they are, concern it, blind.
27|67|and those who disbeliev say, "when we have becom dust as well as our forefathers, will we inde be brought out [of the graves]?
27|68|w have been promis this, we and our forefathers, before. thi is not but legend of the former peoples."
27|69|say, [O muhammad], "travel through the land and observ how wa the end of the criminals."
27|70|and griev not over them or be in distress from what they conspire.
27|71|and they say, "when is [the fulfil of] thi promise, if you should be truthful?"
27|72|say, "perhap it is close behind you - some of that for which you are impatient.
27|73|and indeed, your lord is full of bounti for the people, but most of them do not show gratitude."
27|74|and indeed, your lord know what their breast conceal and what they declare.
27|75|and there is noth conceal within the heaven and the earth except that it is in a clear register.
27|76|indeed, thi qur'an relat to the children of israel most of that over which they disagree.
27|77|and indeed, it is guidanc and merci for the believers.
27|78|indeed, your lord will judg between them by hi [wise] judgement. and He is the exalt in might, the knowing.
27|79|so reli upon allah; indeed, you are upon the clear truth.
27|80|indeed, you will not make the dead hear, nor will you make the deaf hear the call when they have turn their back retreating.
27|81|and you cannot guid the blind away from their error. you will onli make hear those who believ in our vers so they are muslim [submit to allah].
27|82|and when the word befal them, We will bring forth for them a creatur from the earth speak to them, [saying] that the peopl were, of our verses, not certain [in faith].
27|83|and [warn of] the day when We will gather from everi nation a compani of those who deni our signs, and they will be [driven] in rows
27|84|until, when they arriv [at the place of judgement], He will say, "did you deni My sign while you encompass them not in knowledge, or what [wa it that] you were doing?"
27|85|and the decre will befal them for the wrong they did, and they will not [be abl to] speak.
27|86|do they not see that We made the night that they may rest therein and the day give sight? inde in that are sign for a peopl who believe.
27|87|and [warn of] the day the horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heaven and whoever is on the earth will be terrifi except whom allah wills. and all will come to him humbled.
27|88|and you see the mountains, think them rigid, while they will pass as the pass of clouds. [it is] the work of allah, who perfect all things. indeed, He is acquaint with that which you do.
27|89|whoev come [at judgement] with a good deed will have better than it, and they, from the terror of that day, will be safe.
27|90|and whoever come with an evil deed - their face will be overturn into the fire, [and it will be said], "are you recompens except for what you use to do?"
27|91|[say, O muhammad], "I have onli been command to worship the lord of thi city, who made it sacr and to whom [belongs] all things. and I am command to be of the muslim [those who submit to allah]
27|92|and to recit the qur'an." and whoever is guid is onli guid for [the benefit of] himself; and whoever stray - say, "I am onli [one] of the warners."
27|93|and say, "[all] prais is [due] to allah. He will show you hi signs, and you will recogn them. and your lord is not unawar of what you do."
28|1|ta, seen, meem.
28|2|thes are the vers of the clear book.
28|3|w recit to you from the news of mose and pharaoh in truth for a peopl who believe.
28|4|indeed, pharaoh exalt himself in the land and made it peopl into factions, oppress a sector among them, slaughter their [newborn] son and keep their femal alive. indeed, he wa of the corrupters.
28|5|and We want to confer favor upon those who were oppress in the land and make them leader and make them inheritors
28|6|and establish them in the land and show pharaoh and [hi minister] haman and their soldier through them that which they had feared.
28|7|and We inspir to the mother of moses, "suckl him; but when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear and do not grieve. indeed, We will return him to you and will make him [one] of the messengers."
28|8|and the famili of pharaoh pick him up [out of the river] so that he would becom to them an enemi and a [caus of] grief. indeed, pharaoh and haman and their soldier were deliber sinners.
28|9|and the wife of pharaoh said, "[he will be] a comfort of the eye for me and for you. Do not kill him; perhap he may benefit us, or we may adopt him as a son." and they perceiv not.
28|10|and the heart of moses' mother becam empti [of all else]. she wa about to disclos [the matter concerning] him had We not bound fast her heart that she would be of the believers.
28|11|and she said to hi sister, "follow him"; so she watch him from a distanc while they perceiv not.
28|12|and We had prevent from him [all] wet nurs before, so she said, "shall I direct you to a household that will be respons for him for you while they are to him [for hi upbringing] sincere?"
28|13|so We restor him to hi mother that she might be content and not griev and that she would know that the promis of allah is true. but most of the peopl do not know.
28|14|and when he attain hi full strength and wa [mentally] mature, We bestow upon him judgement and knowledge. and thu do We reward the doer of good.
28|15|and he enter the citi at a time of inattent by it peopl and found therein two men fighting: one from hi faction and one from among hi enemy. and the one from hi faction call for help to him against the one from hi enemy, so mose struck him and [unintentionally] kill him. [moses] said, "thi is from the work of satan. indeed, he is a manifest, mislead enemy."
28|16|h said, "mi lord, inde I have wrong myself, so forgiv me," and He forgav him. indeed, He is the forgiving, the merciful.
28|17|h said, "mi lord, for the favor you bestow upon me, I will never be an assist to the criminals."
28|18|and he becam insid the citi fear and anticip [exposure], when suddenli the one who sought hi help the previou day cri out to him [onc again]. mose said to him, "indeed, you are an evident, [persistent] deviator."
28|19|and when he want to strike the one who wa an enemi to both of them, he said, "O moses, do you intend to kill me as you kill someon yesterday? you onli want to be a tyrant in the land and do not want to be of the amenders."
28|20|and a man came from the farthest end of the city, running. He said, "O moses, inde the emin one are confer over you [intending] to kill you, so leav [the city]; indeed, I am to you of the sincer advisors."
28|21|so he left it, fear and anticip [apprehension]. He said, "mi lord, save me from the wrongdo people."
28|22|and when he direct himself toward madyan, he said, "perhap my lord will guid me to the sound way."
28|23|and when he came to the well of madyan, he found there a crowd of peopl water [their flocks], and he found asid from them two women drive back [their flocks]. He said, "what is your circumstance?" they said, "we do not water until the shepherd dispatch [their flocks]; and our father is an old man."
28|24|so he water [their flocks] for them; then he went back to the shade and said, "mi lord, inde I am, for whatev good you would send down to me, in need."
28|25|then one of the two women came to him walk with shyness. she said, "indeed, my father invit you that he may reward you for have water for us." So when he came to him and relat to him the story, he said, "fear not. you have escap from the wrongdo people."
28|26|on of the women said, "O my father, hire him. indeed, the best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy."
28|27|h said, "indeed, I wish to wed you one of these, my two daughters, on [the condition] that you serv me for eight years; but if you complet ten, it will be [a a favor] from you. and I do not wish to put you in difficulty. you will find me, if allah wills, from among the righteous."
28|28|[moses] said, "that is [established] between me and you. whichev of the two term I complet - there is no injustic to me, and allah, over what we say, is witness."
28|29|and when mose had complet the term and wa travel with hi family, he perceiv from the direct of the mount a fire. He said to hi family, "stay here; indeed, I have perceiv a fire. perhap I will bring you from there [some] inform or burn wood from the fire that you may warm yourselves."
28|30|but when he came to it, he wa call from the right side of the valley in a bless spot - from the tree, "O moses, inde I am allah, lord of the worlds."
28|31|and [he wa told], "throw down your staff." but when he saw it writh as if it wa a snake, he turn in flight and did not return. [allah said], "O moses, approach and fear not. indeed, you are of the secure.
28|32|insert your hand into the open of your garment; it will come out white, without disease. and draw in your arm close to you [a prevention] from fear, for those are two proof from your lord to pharaoh and hi establishment. indeed, they have been a peopl defiantli disobedient."
28|33|h said, "mi lord, indeed, I kill from among them someone, and I fear they will kill me.
28|34|and my brother aaron is more fluent than me in tongue, so send him with me as support, verifi me. indeed, I fear that they will deni me."
28|35|[allah] said, "we will strengthen your arm through your brother and grant you both supremaci so they will not reach you. [it will be] through our signs; you and those who follow you will be the predominant."
28|36|but when mose came to them with our sign as clear evidences, they said, "thi is not except invent magic, and we have not heard of thi [religion] among our forefathers."
28|37|and mose said, "mi lord is more know [than we or you] of who ha come with guidanc from him and to whom will be success in the home. indeed, wrongdoer do not succeed."
28|38|and pharaoh said, "O emin ones, I have not known you to have a god other than me. then ignit for me, O haman, [a fire] upon the clay and make for me a tower that I may look at the god of moses. and indeed, I do think he is among the liars."
28|39|and he wa arrogant, he and hi soldiers, in the land, without right, and they thought that they would not be return to us.
28|40|so We took him and hi soldier and threw them into the sea. So see how wa the end of the wrongdoers.
28|41|and We made them leader invit to the fire, and on the day of resurrect they will not be helped.
28|42|and We caus to overtak them in thi world a curse, and on the day of resurrect they will be of the despised.
28|43|and We gave mose the scripture, after We had destroy the former generations, as enlighten for the peopl and guidanc and merci that they might be reminded.
28|44|and you, [O muhammad], were not on the western side [of the mount] when We reveal to mose the command, and you were not among the wit [to that].
28|45|but We produc [many] gener [after moses], and prolong wa their duration. and you were not a resid among the peopl of madyan, recit to them our verses, but We were sender [of thi message].
28|46|and you were not at the side of the mount when We call [moses] but [were sent] as a merci from your lord to warn a peopl to whom no warner had come befor you that they might be reminded.
28|47|and if not that a disast should strike them for what their hand put forth [of sins] and they would say, "our lord, whi did you not send us a messeng so we could have follow your vers and been among the believers?"...
28|48|but when the truth came to them from us, they said, "whi wa he not given like that which wa given to moses?" did they not disbeliev in that which wa given to mose before? they said, "[they are but] two work of magic support each other, and inde we are, in both, disbelievers."
28|49|say, "then bring a scriptur from allah which is more guid than either of them that I may follow it, if you should be truthful."
28|50|but if they do not respond to you - then know that they onli follow their [own] desires. and who is more astray than one who follow hi desir without guidanc from allah? indeed, allah doe not guid the wrongdo people.
28|51|and We have [repeatedly] convey to them the qur'an that they might be reminded.
28|52|thos to whom We gave the scriptur befor it - they are believ in it.
28|53|and when it is recit to them, they say, "we have believ in it; indeed, it is the truth from our lord. inde we were, [even] befor it, muslim [submit to allah]."
28|54|thos will be given their reward twice for what they patient endur and [because] they avert evil through good, and from what We have provid them they spend.
28|55|and when they hear ill speech, they turn away from it and say, "for us are our deeds, and for you are your deeds. peac will be upon you; we seek not the ignorant."
28|56|indeed, [O muhammad], you do not guid whom you like, but allah guid whom He wills. and He is most know of the [rightly] guided.
28|57|and they say, "if we were to follow the guidanc with you, we would be swept from our land." have we not establish for them a safe sanctuari to which are brought the fruit of all thing as provis from us? but most of them do not know.
28|58|and how mani a citi have We destroy that wa insol in it [way of] living, and those are their dwell which have not been inhabit after them except briefly. and it is We who were the inheritors.
28|59|and never would your lord have destroy the citi until He had sent to their mother a messeng recit to them our verses. and We would not destroy the citi except while their peopl were wrongdoers.
28|60|and whatev thing you [people] have been given - it is [onli for] the enjoy of worldli life and it adornment. and what is with allah is better and more lasting; so will you not use reason?
28|61|then is he whom We have promis a good promis which he will obtain like he for whom We provid enjoy of worldli life [but] then he is, on the day of resurrection, among those present [for punish in hell]?
28|62|and [warn of] the day He will call them and say, "where are My 'partners' which you use to claim?"
28|63|thos upon whom the word will have come into effect will say, "our lord, these are the one we led to error. We led them to error just as we were in error. We declar our disassoci [from them] to you. they did not use to worship us."
28|64|and it will be said, "invok your 'partners' " and they will invok them; but they will not respond to them, and they will see the punishment. If onli they had follow guidance!
28|65|and [mention] the day He will call them and say, "what did you answer the messengers?"
28|66|but the inform will be unappar to them that day, so they will not [be abl to] ask one another.
28|67|but as for one who had repented, believed, and done righteousness, it is promis by allah that he will be among the successful.
28|68|and your lord creat what He will and chooses; not for them wa the choice. exalt is allah and high abov what they associ with him.
28|69|and your lord know what their breast conceal and what they declare.
28|70|and He is allah; there is no deiti except him. To him is [due all] prais in the first [life] and the hereafter. and hi is the [final] decision, and to him you will be returned.
28|71|say, "have you considered: if allah should make for you the night continu until the day of resurrection, what deiti other than allah could bring you light? then will you not hear?"
28|72|say, "have you considered: if allah should make for you the day continu until the day of resurrection, what deiti other than allah could bring you a night in which you may rest? then will you not see?"
28|73|and out of hi merci He made for you the night and the day that you may rest therein and [bi day] seek from hi bounti and [that] perhap you will be grateful.
28|74|and [warn of] the day He will call them and say, "where are my 'partners' which you use to claim?"
28|75|and We will extract from everi nation a wit and say, "produc your proof," and they will know that the truth belong to allah, and lost from them is that which they use to invent.
28|76|indeed, qarun wa from the peopl of moses, but he tyrann them. and We gave him of treasur whose key would burden a band of strong men; thereupon hi peopl said to him, "do not exult. indeed, allah doe not like the exultant.
28|77|but seek, through that which allah ha given you, the home of the hereafter; and [yet], do not forget your share of the world. and do good as allah ha done good to you. and desir not corrupt in the land. indeed, allah doe not like corrupters."
28|78|h said, "I wa onli given it becaus of knowledg I have." did he not know that allah had destroy befor him of gener those who were greater than him in power and greater in accumul [of wealth]? but the criminals, about their sins, will not be asked.
28|79|so he came out befor hi peopl in hi adornment. those who desir the worldli life said, "oh, would that we had like what wa given to qarun. indeed, he is one of great fortune."
28|80|but those who had been given knowledg said, "woe to you! the reward of allah is better for he who believ and doe righteousness. and none are grant it except the patient."
28|81|and We caus the earth to swallow him and hi home. and there wa for him no compani to aid him other than allah, nor wa he of those who [could] defend themselves.
28|82|and those who had wish for hi posit the previou day began to say, "oh, how allah extend provis to whom He will of hi servant and restrict it! If not that allah had confer favor on us, He would have caus it to swallow us. oh, how the disbeliev do not succeed!"

29|2|do the peopl think that they will be left to say, "we believe" and they will not be tried?
29|3|but We have certainli tri those befor them, and allah will sure make evid those who are truthful, and He will sure make evid the liars.
29|4|or do those who do evil deed think they can outrun us? evil is what they judge.
29|5|whoev should hope for the meet with allah - indeed, the term decre by allah is coming. and He is the hearing, the knowing.
29|6|and whoever strive onli strive for [the benefit of] himself. indeed, allah is free from need of the worlds.

29|10|and of the peopl are some who say, "we believ in allah," but when one [of them] is harm for [the caus of] allah, they consid the trial of the peopl as [if it were] the punish of allah. but if victori come from your lord, they say, "indeed, We were with you." Is not allah most know of what is within the breast of all creatures?
29|11|and allah will sure make evid those who believe, and He will sure make evid the hypocrites.
29|12|and those who disbeliev say to those who believe, "follow our way, and we will carri your sins." but they will not carri anyth of their sins. indeed, they are liars.
29|13|but they will sure carri their [own] burden and [other] burden along with their burdens, and they will sure be question on the day of resurrect about what they use to invent.
29|14|and We certainli sent noah to hi people, and he remain among them a thousand year minu fifti years, and the flood seiz them while they were wrongdoers.
29|15|but We save him and the companion of the ship, and We made it a sign for the worlds.
29|16|and [we sent] abraham, when he said to hi people, "worship allah and fear him. that is best for you, if you should know.
29|17|you onli worship, besid allah, idols, and you produc a falsehood. indeed, those you worship besid allah do not possess for you [the power of] provision. So seek from allah provis and worship him and be grate to him. To him you will be returned."
29|18|and if you [people] deni [the message] - alreadi nation befor you have denied. and there is not upon the messeng except [the duti of] clear notification.
29|19|hav they not consid how allah begin creation and then repeat it? inde that, for allah, is easy.
29|20|say, [O muhammad], "travel through the land and observ how He began creation. then allah will produc the final creation. inde allah, over all things, is competent."
29|21|h punish whom He will and ha merci upon whom He wills, and to him you will be returned.
29|22|and you will not caus failur [to allah] upon the earth or in the heaven. and you have not other than allah ani protector or ani helper.
29|23|and the one who disbeliev in the sign of allah and the meet with him - those have despair of My mercy, and they will have a pain punishment.
29|24|and the answer of abraham' peopl wa not but that they said, "kill him or burn him," but allah save him from the fire. inde in that are sign for a peopl who believe.
29|25|and [abraham] said, "you have onli taken, other than allah, idol as [a bond of] affect among you in worldli life. then on the day of resurrect you will deni one anoth and curs one another, and your refug will be the fire, and you will not have ani helpers."
29|26|and lot believ him. [abraham] said, "indeed, I will emigr to [the servic of] my lord. indeed, He is the exalt in might, the wise."
29|27|and We gave to him isaac and jacob and place in hi descend prophethood and scripture. and We gave him hi reward in thi world, and indeed, he is in the hereaft among the righteous.
29|28|and [mention] lot, when he said to hi people, "indeed, you commit such immor as no one ha preced you with from among the worlds.
29|29|indeed, you approach men and obstruct the road and commit in your meet [every] evil." and the answer of hi peopl wa not but they said, "bring us the punish of allah, if you should be of the truthful."
29|30|h said, "mi lord, support me against the corrupt people."
29|31|and when our messeng came to abraham with the good tidings, they said, "indeed, we will destroy the peopl of that lot' city. indeed, it peopl have been wrongdoers."
29|32|[abraham] said, "indeed, within it is lot." they said, "we are more know of who is within it. We will sure save him and hi family, except hi wife. she is to be of those who remain behind."
29|33|and when our messeng came to lot, he wa distress for them and felt for them great discomfort. they said, "fear not, nor grieve. indeed, we will save you and your family, except your wife; she is to be of those who remain behind.
29|34|indeed, we will bring down on the peopl of thi citi punish from the sky becaus they have been defiantli disobedient."
29|35|and We have certainli left of it a sign as clear evid for a peopl who use reason.
29|36|and to madyan [we sent] their brother shu'ayb, and he said, "O my people, worship allah and expect the last day and do not commit abus on the earth, spread corruption."
29|37|but they deni him, so the earthquak seiz them, and they becam within their home [corpses] fallen prone.
29|38|and [we destroyed] 'aad and thamud, and it ha becom clear to you from their [ruined] dwellings. and satan had made pleas to them their deed and avert them from the path, and they were endow with perception.
29|39|and [we destroyed] qarun and pharaoh and haman. and mose had alreadi come to them with clear evidences, and they were arrog in the land, but they were not outrunn [of our punishment].
29|40|so each We seiz for hi sin; and among them were those upon whom We sent a storm of stones, and among them were those who were seiz by the blast [from the sky], and among them were those whom We caus the earth to swallow, and among them were those whom We drowned. and allah would not have wrong them, but it wa they who were wrong themselves.
29|41|th exampl of those who take alli other than allah is like that of the spider who take a home. and indeed, the weakest of home is the home of the spider, if they onli knew.
29|42|indeed, allah know whatev thing they call upon other than him. and He is the exalt in might, the wise.
29|43|and these exampl We present to the people, but none will understand them except those of knowledge.
29|44|allah creat the heaven and the earth in truth. inde in that is a sign for the believers.
29|45|recite, [O muhammad], what ha been reveal to you of the book and establish prayer. indeed, prayer prohibit immor and wrongdoing, and the remembr of allah is greater. and allah know that which you do.
29|46|and do not argu with the peopl of the scriptur except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustic among them, and say, "we believ in that which ha been reveal to us and reveal to you. and our god and your god is one; and we are muslim [in submission] to him."
29|47|and thu We have sent down to you the qur'an. and those to whom We [previously] gave the scriptur believ in it. and among these [peopl of makkah] are those who believ in it. and none reject our vers except the disbelievers.
29|48|and you did not recit befor it ani scripture, nor did you inscrib one with your right hand. otherwis the falsifi would have had [caus for] doubt.
29|49|rather, the qur'an is distinct vers [preserved] within the breast of those who have been given knowledge. and none reject our vers except the wrongdoers.
29|50|but they say, "whi are not sign sent down to him from hi lord?" say, "the sign are onli with allah, and I am onli a clear warner."
29|51|and is it not suffici for them that We reveal to you the book which is recit to them? inde in that is a merci and remind for a peopl who believe.
29|52|say, "suffici is allah between me and you as witness. He know what is in the heaven and earth. and they who have believ in falsehood and disbeliev in allah - it is those who are the losers."
29|53|and they urg you to hasten the punishment. and if not for [the decre of] a specifi term, punish would have reach them. but it will sure come to them suddenli while they perceiv not.
29|54|they urg you to hasten the punishment. and indeed, hell will be encompass of the disbelievers
29|55|on the day the punish will cover them from abov them and from below their feet and it is said, "tast [the result of] what you use to do."
29|56|o My servant who have believed, inde My earth is spacious, so worship onli me.
29|57|everi soul will tast death. then to Us will you be returned.
29|58|and those who have believ and done righteou deed - We will sure assign to them of paradis [elevated] chamber beneath which river flow, wherein they abid eternally. excel is the reward of the [righteous] workers
29|59|who have been patient and upon their lord rely.
29|60|and how mani a creatur carri not it [own] provision. allah provid for it and for you. and He is the hearing, the knowing.
29|61|if you ask them, "who creat the heaven and earth and subject the sun and the moon?" they would sure say, "allah." then how are they deluded?
29|62|allah extend provis for whom He will of hi servant and restrict for him. inde allah is, of all things, knowing.
29|63|and if you ask them, "who send down rain from the sky and give life therebi to the earth after it lifelessness?" they would sure say " allah." say, "prais to allah "; but most of them do not reason.
29|64|and thi worldli life is not but divers and amusement. and indeed, the home of the hereaft - that is the [eternal] life, if onli they knew.
29|65|and when they board a ship, they supplic allah, sincer to him in religion. but when He deliv them to the land, at onc they associ other with him
29|66|so that they will deni what We have grant them, and they will enjoy themselves. but they are go to know.
29|67|hav they not seen that We made [makkah] a safe sanctuary, while peopl are be taken away all around them? then in falsehood do they believe, and in the favor of allah they disbelieve?
29|68|and who is more unjust than one who invent a lie about allah or deni the truth when it ha come to him? Is there not in hell a [sufficient] resid for the disbelievers?
29|69|and those who strive for Us - We will sure guid them to our ways. and indeed, allah is with the doer of good.
30|1|alif, lam, meem.
30|2|th byzantin have been defeated
30|3|in the nearest land. but they, after their defeat, will overcome.
30|4|within three to nine years. To allah belong the command befor and after. and that day the believ will rejoice
30|5|in the victori of allah. He give victori to whom He wills, and He is the exalt in might, the merciful.
30|6|[it is] the promis of allah. allah doe not fail in hi promise, but most of the peopl do not know.
30|7|they know what is appar of the worldli life, but they, of the hereafter, are unaware.
30|8|do they not contempl within themselves? allah ha not creat the heaven and the earth and what is between them except in truth and for a specifi term. and indeed, mani of the people, in [the matter of] the meet with their lord, are disbelievers.
30|9|hav they not travel through the earth and observ how wa the end of those befor them? they were greater than them in power, and they plow the earth and built it up more than they have built it up, and their messeng came to them with clear evidences. and allah would not ever have wrong them, but they were wrong themselves.
30|10|then the end of those who did evil wa the worst [consequence] becaus they deni the sign of allah and use to ridicul them.
30|11|allah begin creation; then He will repeat it; then to him you will be returned.
30|12|and the day the hour appear the crimin will be in despair.
30|13|and there will not be for them among their [alleged] partner ani intercessors, and they will [then] be disbeliev in their partners.
30|14|and the day the hour appear - that day they will becom separated.
30|15|and as for those who had believ and done righteou deeds, they will be in a garden [of paradise], delighted.
30|16|but as for those who disbeliev and deni our vers and the meet of the hereafter, those will be brought into the punish [to remain].
30|17|so exalt is allah when you reach the even and when you reach the morning.
30|18|and to him is [due all] prais throughout the heaven and the earth. and [exalt is he] at night and when you are at noon.
30|19|h bring the live out of the dead and bring the dead out of the live and bring to life the earth after it lifelessness. and thu will you be brought out.
30|20|and of hi sign is that He creat you from dust; then, suddenli you were human be dispers [throughout the earth].
30|21|and of hi sign is that He creat for you from yourselv mate that you may find tranquil in them; and He place between you affect and mercy. inde in that are sign for a peopl who give thought.
30|22|and of hi sign is the creation of the heaven and the earth and the divers of your languag and your colors. inde in that are sign for those of knowledge.
30|23|and of hi sign is your sleep by night and day and your seek of hi bounty. inde in that are sign for a peopl who listen.
30|24|and of hi sign is [that] He show you the lightn [causing] fear and aspiration, and He send down rain from the sky by which He bring to life the earth after it lifelessness. inde in that are sign for a peopl who use reason.
30|25|and of hi sign is that the heaven and earth remain by hi command. then when He call you with a [single] call from the earth, immedi you will come forth.
30|26|and to him belong whoever is in the heaven and earth. all are to him devoutli obedient.
30|27|and it is He who begin creation; then He repeat it, and that is [even] easier for him. To him belong the highest attribut in the heaven and earth. and He is the exalt in might, the wise.
30|28|h present to you an exampl from yourselves. Do you have among those whom your right hand possess ani partner in what We have provid for you so that you are equal therein [and] would fear them as your fear of one anoth [within a partnership]? thu do We detail the vers for a peopl who use reason.
30|29|but those who wrong follow their [own] desir without knowledge. then who can guid one whom allah ha sent astray? and for them there are no helpers.
30|30|so direct your face toward the religion, inclin to truth. [adher to] the fitrah of allah upon which He ha creat [all] people. No chang should there be in the creation of allah. that is the correct religion, but most of the peopl do not know.
30|31|[adher to it], turn in repent to him, and fear him and establish prayer and do not be of those who associ other with allah
30|32|[or] of those who have divid their religion and becom sects, everi faction rejoic in what it has.
30|33|and when advers touch the people, they call upon their lord, turn in repent to him. then when He let them tast merci from him, at onc a parti of them associ other with their lord,
30|34|so that they will deni what We have grant them. then enjoy yourselves, for you are go to know.
30|35|or have We sent down to them an authority, and it speak of what they were associ with him?
30|36|and when We let the peopl tast mercy, they rejoic therein, but if evil afflict them for what their hand have put forth, immedi they despair.
30|37|do they not see that allah extend provis for whom He will and restrict [it]? indeed, in that are sign for a peopl who believe.
30|38|so give the rel hi right, as well as the needi and the traveler. that is best for those who desir the counten of allah, and it is they who will be the successful.
30|39|and whatev you give for interest to increas within the wealth of peopl will not increas with allah. but what you give in zakah, desir the counten of allah - those are the multipliers.
30|40|allah is the one who creat you, then provid for you, then will caus you to die, and then will give you life. are there ani of your "partners" who doe anyth of that? exalt is He and high abov what they associ with him.
30|41|corrupt ha appear throughout the land and sea by [reason of] what the hand of peopl have earn so He may let them tast part of [the consequ of] what they have done that perhap they will return [to righteousness].
30|42|say, [O muhammad], "travel through the land and observ how wa the end of those before. most of them were associ [of other with allah].
30|43|so direct your face toward the correct religion befor a day come from allah of which there is no repelling. that day, they will be divided.
30|44|whoev disbeliev - upon him is [the consequ of] hi disbelief. and whoever doe righteous - they are for themselv preparing,
30|45|that He may reward those who have believ and done righteou deed out of hi bounty. indeed, He doe not like the disbelievers.
30|46|and of hi sign is that He send the wind as bringer of good tide and to let you tast hi merci and so the ship may sail at hi command and so you may seek of hi bounty, and perhap you will be grateful.
30|47|and We have alreadi sent messeng befor you to their peoples, and they came to them with clear evidences; then We took retribut from those who commit crimes, and incumb upon Us wa support of the believers.
30|48|it is allah who send the winds, and they stir the cloud and spread them in the sky howev He wills, and He make them fragment so you see the rain emerg from within them. and when He caus it to fall upon whom He will of hi servants, immedi they rejoice
30|49|although they were, befor it wa sent down upon them - befor that, in despair.
30|50|so observ the effect of the merci of allah - how He give life to the earth after it lifelessness. indeed, that [same one] will give life to the dead, and He is over all thing competent.
30|51|but if We should send a [bad] wind and they saw [their crops] turn yellow, they would remain thereaft disbelievers.
30|52|so indeed, you will not make the dead hear, nor will you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs, retreating.
30|53|and you cannot guid the blind away from their error. you will onli make hear those who believ in our vers so they are muslim [in submiss to allah].
30|54|allah is the one who creat you from weakness, then made after weak strength, then made after strength weak and white hair. He creat what He wills, and He is the knowing, the competent.
30|55|and the day the hour appear the crimin will swear they had remain but an hour. thu they were deluded.
30|56|but those who were given knowledg and faith will say, "you remain the extent of allah 's decre until the day of resurrection, and thi is the day of resurrection, but you did not use to know."
30|57|so that day, their excus will not benefit those who wronged, nor will they be ask to appeas [allah].
30|58|and We have certainli present to the peopl in thi qur'an from everi [kind of] example. but, [O muhammad], if you should bring them a sign, the disbeliev will sure say, "you [believers] are but falsifiers."
30|59|thu doe allah seal the heart of those who do not know.
30|60|so be patient. indeed, the promis of allah is truth. and let them not disquiet you who are not certain [in faith].
31|1|alif, lam, meem.
31|2|thes are vers of the wise book,
31|3|a guidanc and merci for the doer of good
31|4|who establish prayer and give zakah, and they, of the hereafter, are certain [in faith].
31|5|thos are on [right] guidanc from their lord, and it is those who are the successful.
31|6|and of the peopl is he who buy the amus of speech to mislead [others] from the way of allah without knowledg and who take it in ridicule. those will have a humili punishment.
31|7|and when our vers are recit to him, he turn away arrogantli as if he had not heard them, as if there wa in hi ear deafness. So give him tide of a pain punishment.
31|8|indeed, those who believ and do righteou deed - for them are the garden of pleasure.
31|9|wherein they abid eternally; [it is] the promis of allah [which is] truth. and He is the exalt in might, the wise.
31|10|h creat the heaven without pillar that you see and ha cast into the earth firmli set mountains, lest it should shift with you, and dispers therein from everi creature. and We sent down rain from the sky and made grow therein [plants] of everi nobl kind.
31|11|thi is the creation of allah. So show Me what those other than him have created. rather, the wrongdoer are in clear error.
31|12|and We had certainli given luqman wisdom [and said], "be grate to allah." and whoever is grate is grate for [the benefit of] himself. and whoever deni [hi favor] - then indeed, allah is free of need and praiseworthy.
31|13|and [mention, O muhammad], when luqman said to hi son while he wa instruct him, "O my son, do not associ [anything] with allah. indeed, associ [with him] is great injustice."
31|14|and We have enjoin upon man [care] for hi parents. hi mother carri him, [increas her] in weak upon weakness, and hi wean is in two years. Be grate to Me and to your parents; to Me is the [final] destination.
31|15|but if they endeavor to make you associ with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them but accompani them in [this] world with appropri kind and follow the way of those who turn back to Me [in repentance]. then to Me will be your return, and I will inform you about what you use to do.
31|16|[and luqman said], "O my son, inde if wrong should be the weight of a mustard seed and should be within a rock or [anywhere] in the heaven or in the earth, allah will bring it forth. indeed, allah is subtl and acquainted.
31|17|o my son, establish prayer, enjoin what is right, forbid what is wrong, and be patient over what befal you. indeed, [all] that is of the matter [requiring] determination.
31|18|and do not turn your cheek [in contempt] toward peopl and do not walk through the earth exultantly. indeed, allah doe not like everyon self-delud and boastful.
31|19|and be moder in your pace and lower your voice; indeed, the most disagre of sound is the voic of donkeys."
31|20|do you not see that allah ha made subject to you whatev is in the heaven and whatev is in the earth and ampli bestow upon you hi favors, [both] appar and unapparent? but of the peopl is he who disput about allah without knowledg or guidanc or an enlighten book [from him].
31|21|and when it is said to them, "follow what allah ha revealed," they say, "rather, we will follow that upon which we found our fathers." even if satan wa invit them to the punish of the blaze?
31|22|and whoever submit hi face to allah while he is a doer of good - then he ha grasp the most trustworthi handhold. and to allah will be the outcom of [all] matters.
31|23|and whoever ha disbeliev - let not hi disbelief griev you. To Us is their return, and We will inform them of what they did. indeed, allah is know of that within the breasts.
31|24|w grant them enjoy for a little; then We will forc them to a massiv punishment.
31|25|and if you ask them, "who creat the heaven and earth?" they would sure say, "allah." say, "[all] prais is [due] to allah "; but most of them do not know.
31|26|to allah belong whatev is in the heaven and earth. indeed, allah is the free of need, the praiseworthy.
31|27|and if whatev tree upon the earth were pen and the sea [wa ink], replenish thereaft by seven [more] seas, the word of allah would not be exhausted. indeed, allah is exalt in might and wise.
31|28|your creation and your resurrect will not be but as that of a singl soul. indeed, allah is hear and seeing.
31|29|do you not see that allah caus the night to enter the day and caus the day to enter the night and ha subject the sun and the moon, each run [it course] for a specifi term, and that allah, with whatev you do, is acquainted?
31|30|that is becaus allah is the truth, and that what they call upon other than him is falsehood, and becaus allah is the most high, the grand.
31|31|do you not see that ship sail through the sea by the favor of allah that He may show you of hi signs? inde in that are sign for everyon patient and grateful.
31|32|and when wave come over them like canopies, they supplic allah, sincer to him in religion. but when He deliv them to the land, there are [some] of them who are moder [in faith]. and none reject our sign except everyon treacher and ungrateful.
31|33|o mankind, fear your lord and fear a day when no father will avail hi son, nor will a son avail hi father at all. indeed, the promis of allah is truth, so let not the worldli life delud you and be not deceiv about allah by the deceiver.
31|34|indeed, allah [alone] ha knowledg of the hour and send down the rain and know what is in the wombs. and no soul perceiv what it will earn tomorrow, and no soul perceiv in what land it will die. indeed, allah is know and acquainted.
32|1|alif, lam, meem.
32|2|[thi is] the revel of the book about which there is no doubt from the lord of the worlds.
32|3|or do they say, "he invent it"? rather, it is the truth from your lord, [O muhammad], that you may warn a peopl to whom no warner ha come befor you [so] perhap they will be guided.
32|4|it is allah who creat the heaven and the earth and whatev is between them in six days; then He establish himself abov the throne. you have not besid him ani protector or ani intercessor; so will you not be reminded?
32|5|h arrang [each] matter from the heaven to the earth; then it will ascend to him in a day, the extent of which is a thousand year of those which you count.
32|6|that is the knower of the unseen and the witnessed, the exalt in might, the merciful,
32|7|who perfect everyth which He creat and began the creation of man from clay.
32|8|then He made hi poster out of the extract of a liquid disdained.
32|9|then He proport him and breath into him from hi [created] soul and made for you hear and vision and hearts; littl are you grateful.
32|10|and they say, "when we are lost within the earth, will we inde be [recreated] in a new creation?" rather, they are, in [the matter of] the meet with their lord, disbelievers.
32|11|say, "the angel of death will take you who ha been entrust with you. then to your lord you will be returned."
32|12|if you could but see when the crimin are hang their head befor their lord, [saying], "our lord, we have seen and heard, so return us [to the world]; we will work righteousness. indeed, we are [now] certain."
32|13|and if We had willed, We could have given everi soul it guidance, but the word from Me will come into effect [that] "I will sure fill hell with jinn and peopl all together.
32|14|so tast [punishment] becaus you forgot the meet of this, your day; indeed, We have [accordingly] forgotten you. and tast the punish of etern for what you use to do."
32|15|onli those believ in our vers who, when they are remind by them, fall down in prostrat and exalt [allah] with prais of their lord, and they are not arrogant.
32|16|they aris from [their] beds; they supplic their lord in fear and aspiration, and from what We have provid them, they spend.
32|17|and no soul know what ha been hidden for them of comfort for eye as reward for what they use to do.
32|18|then is one who wa a believ like one who wa defiantli disobedient? they are not equal.
32|19|a for those who believ and did righteou deeds, for them will be the garden of refug as accommod for what they use to do.
32|20|but as for those who defiantli disobeyed, their refug is the fire. everi time they wish to emerg from it, they will be return to it while it is said to them, "tast the punish of the fire which you use to deny."
32|21|and we will sure let them tast the nearer punish short of the greater punish that perhap they will repent.
32|22|and who is more unjust than one who is remind of the vers of hi lord; then he turn away from them? inde we, from the criminals, will take retribution.
32|23|and We certainli gave mose the scripture, so do not be in doubt over hi meeting. and we made the torah guidanc for the children of israel.
32|24|and We made from among them leader guid by our command when they were patient and [when] they were certain of our signs.
32|25|indeed, your lord will judg between them on the day of resurrect concern that over which they use to differ.
32|26|ha it not becom clear to them how mani gener We destroy befor them, [as] they walk among their dwellings? inde in that are signs; then do they not hear?
32|27|hav they not seen that We drive the water [in clouds] to barren land and bring forth therebi crop from which their livestock eat and [they] themselves? then do they not see?
32|28|and they say, "when will be thi conquest, if you should be truthful?"
32|29|say, [O muhammad], "on the day of conquest the belief of those who had disbeliev will not benefit them, nor will they be reprieved."
32|30|so turn away from them and wait. indeed, they are waiting.
33|1|o prophet, fear allah and do not obey the disbeliev and the hypocrites. indeed, allah is ever know and wise.
33|2|and follow that which is reveal to you from your lord. inde allah is ever, with what you do, acquainted.
33|3|and reli upon allah; and suffici is allah as dispos of affairs.
33|4|allah ha not made for a man two heart in hi interior. and He ha not made your wive whom you declar unlaw your mothers. and he ha not made your adopt son your [true] sons. that is [merely] your say by your mouths, but allah say the truth, and He guid to the [right] way.
33|5|cal them by [the name of] their fathers; it is more just in the sight of allah. but if you do not know their father - then they are [still] your brother in religion and those entrust to you. and there is no blame upon you for that in which you have er but [onli for] what your heart intended. and ever is allah forgiv and merciful.
33|6|th prophet is more worthi of the believ than themselves, and hi wive are [in the posit of] their mothers. and those of [blood] relationship are more entitl [to inheritance] in the decre of allah than the [other] believ and the emigrants, except that you may do to your close associ a kind [through bequest]. that wa in the book inscribed.
33|7|and [mention, O muhammad], when We took from the prophet their coven and from you and from noah and abraham and mose and jesus, the son of mary; and We took from them a solemn covenant.
33|8|that He may question the truth about their truth. and He ha prepar for the disbeliev a pain punishment.
33|9|o you who have believed, rememb the favor of allah upon you when armi came to [attack] you and We sent upon them a wind and armi [of angels] you did not see. and ever is allah, of what you do, seeing.
33|10|[remember] when they came at you from abov you and from below you, and when eye shift [in fear], and heart reach the throat and you assum about allah [various] assumptions.
33|11|ther the believ were test and shaken with a sever shaking.
33|12|and [remember] when the hypocrit and those in whose heart is diseas said, "allah and hi messeng did not promis us except delusion,"
33|13|and when a faction of them said, "O peopl of yathrib, there is no stabil for you [here], so return [home]." and a parti of them ask permiss of the prophet, saying, "indeed, our hous are unprotected," while they were not exposed. they did not intend except to flee.
33|14|and if they had been enter upon from all it [surrounding] region and fitnah had been demand of them, they would have done it and not hesit over it except briefly.
33|15|and they had alreadi promis allah befor not to turn their back and flee. and ever is the promis to allah [that about which one will be] questioned.
33|16|say, [O muhammad], "never will flee benefit you if you should flee from death or killing; and then [if you did], you would not be given enjoy [of life] except for a little."
33|17|say, "who is it that can protect you from allah if He intend for you an ill or intend for you a mercy?" and they will not find for themselv besid allah ani protector or ani helper.
33|18|alreadi allah know the hinder among you and those [hypocrites] who say to their brothers, "come to us," and do not go to battle, except for a few,
33|19|indispos toward you. and when fear comes, you see them look at you, their eye revolv like one be overcom by death. but when fear departs, they lash you with sharp tongues, indispos toward [any] good. those have not believed, so allah ha render their deed worthless, and ever is that, for allah, easy.
33|20|they think the compani have not [yet] withdrawn. and if the compani should come [again], they would wish they were in the desert among the bedouins, inquir [from afar] about your news. and if they should be among you, they would not fight except for a little.
33|21|ther ha certainli been for you in the messeng of allah an excel pattern for anyon whose hope is in allah and the last day and [who] rememb allah often.
33|22|and when the believ saw the companies, they said, "thi is what allah and hi messeng had promis us, and allah and hi messeng spoke the truth." and it increas them onli in faith and acceptance.
33|23|among the believ are men true to what they promis allah. among them is he who ha fulfil hi vow [to the death], and among them is he who await [hi chance]. and they did not alter [the term of their commitment] by ani alter -
33|24|that allah may reward the truth for their truth and punish the hypocrit if He will or accept their repentance. indeed, allah is ever forgiv and merciful.
33|25|and allah repel those who disbelieved, in their rage, not have obtain ani good. and suffici wa allah for the believ in battle, and ever is allah power and exalt in might.
33|26|and He brought down those who support them among the peopl of the scriptur from their fortress and cast terror into their heart [so that] a parti you killed, and you took captiv a party.
33|27|and He caus you to inherit their land and their home and their properti and a land which you have not trodden. and ever is allah, over all things, competent.
33|28|o prophet, say to your wives, "if you should desir the worldli life and it adornment, then come, I will provid for you and give you a graciou release.
33|29|but if you should desir allah and hi messeng and the home of the hereaft - then indeed, allah ha prepar for the doer of good among you a great reward."
33|30|o wive of the prophet, whoever of you should commit a clear immor - for her the punish would be doubl two fold, and ever is that, for allah, easy.
33|31|and whoever of you devoutli obey allah and hi messeng and doe righteous - We will give her her reward twice; and We have prepar for her a nobl provision.
33|32|o wive of the prophet, you are not like anyon among women. If you fear allah, then do not be soft in speech [to men], lest he in whose heart is diseas should covet, but speak with appropri speech.
33|33|and abid in your hous and do not display yourselv as [was] the display of the former time of ignorance. and establish prayer and give zakah and obey allah and hi messenger. allah intend onli to remov from you the impur [of sin], O peopl of the [prophet's] household, and to purifi you with [extensive] purification.
33|34|and rememb what is recit in your hous of the vers of allah and wisdom. indeed, allah is ever subtl and acquaint [with all things].
33|35|indeed, the muslim men and muslim women, the believ men and believ women, the obedi men and obedi women, the truth men and truth women, the patient men and patient women, the humbl men and humbl women, the charit men and charit women, the fast men and fast women, the men who guard their privat part and the women who do so, and the men who rememb allah often and the women who do so - for them allah ha prepar forgiv and a great reward.
33|36|it is not for a believ man or a believ woman, when allah and hi messeng have decid a matter, that they should [thereafter] have ani choic about their affair. and whoever disobey allah and hi messeng ha certainli stray into clear error.
33|37|and [remember, O muhammad], when you said to the one on whom allah bestow favor and you bestow favor, "keep your wife and fear allah," while you conceal within yourself that which allah is to disclose. and you fear the people, while allah ha more right that you fear him. So when zayd had no longer ani need for her, We marri her to you in order that there not be upon the believ ani discomfort concern the wive of their adopt son when they no longer have need of them. and ever is the command of allah accomplished.
33|38|ther is not to be upon the prophet ani discomfort concern that which allah ha impos upon him. [thi is] the establish way of allah with those [prophets] who have pass on before. and ever is the command of allah a destini decreed.
33|39|[allah praises] those who convey the messag of allah and fear him and do not fear anyon but allah. and suffici is allah as accountant.
33|40|muhammad is not the father of [any] one of your men, but [he is] the messeng of allah and last of the prophets. and ever is allah, of all things, knowing.
33|41|o you who have believed, rememb allah with much remembrance
33|42|and exalt him morn and afternoon.
33|43|it is He who confer bless upon you, and hi angel [ask him to do so] that He may bring you out from dark into the light. and ever is he, to the believers, merciful.
33|44|their greet the day they meet him will be, "peace." and He ha prepar for them a nobl reward.
33|45|o prophet, inde We have sent you as a wit and a bringer of good tide and a warner.
33|46|and one who invit to allah, by hi permission, and an illumin lamp.
33|47|and give good tide to the believ that they will have from allah great bounty.
33|48|and do not obey the disbeliev and the hypocrit but do not harm them, and reli upon allah. and suffici is allah as dispos of affairs.
33|49|o you who have believed, when you marri believ women and then divorc them befor you have touch them, then there is not for you ani wait period to count concern them. So provid for them and give them a graciou release.
33|50|o prophet, inde We have made law to you your wive to whom you have given their due compens and those your right hand possess from what allah ha return to you [of captives] and the daughter of your patern uncl and the daughter of your patern aunt and the daughter of your matern uncl and the daughter of your matern aunt who emigr with you and a believ woman if she give herself to the prophet [and] if the prophet wish to marri her, [thi is] onli for you, exclud the [other] believers. We certainli know what We have made obligatori upon them concern their wive and those their right hand possess, [but thi is for you] in order that there will be upon you no discomfort. and ever is allah forgiv and merciful.
33|51|you, [O muhammad], may put asid whom you will of them or take to yourself whom you will. and ani that you desir of those [wives] from whom you had [temporarily] separ - there is no blame upon you [in return her]. that is more suitabl that they should be content and not griev and that they should be satisfi with what you have given them - all of them. and allah know what is in your hearts. and ever is allah know and forbearing.
33|52|not law to you, [O muhammad], are [ani additional] women after [this], nor [i it] for you to exchang them for [other] wives, even if their beauti were to pleas you, except what your right hand possesses. and ever is allah, over all things, an observer.
33|53|o you who have believed, do not enter the hous of the prophet except when you are permit for a meal, without await it readiness. but when you are invited, then enter; and when you have eaten, dispers without seek to remain for conversation. indeed, that [behavior] wa troubl the prophet, and he is shi of [dismissing] you. but allah is not shi of the truth. and when you ask [hi wives] for something, ask them from behind a partition. that is purer for your heart and their hearts. and it is not [conceiv or lawful] for you to harm the messeng of allah or to marri hi wive after him, ever. indeed, that would be in the sight of allah an enormity.
33|54|wheth you reveal a thing or conceal it, inde allah is ever, of all things, knowing.
33|55|ther is no blame upon women concern their father or their son or their brother or their brothers' son or their sisters' son or their women or those their right hand possess. and fear allah. inde allah is ever, over all things, witness.
33|56|indeed, allah confer bless upon the prophet, and hi angel [ask him to do so]. O you who have believed, ask [allah to confer] bless upon him and ask [allah to grant him] peace.
33|57|indeed, those who abus allah and hi messeng - allah ha curs them in thi world and the hereaft and prepar for them a humili punishment.
33|58|and those who harm believ men and believ women for [something] other than what they have earn have certainli born upon themselv a slander and manifest sin.
33|59|o prophet, tell your wive and your daughter and the women of the believ to bring down over themselv [part] of their outer garments. that is more suitabl that they will be known and not be abused. and ever is allah forgiv and merciful.
33|60|if the hypocrit and those in whose heart is diseas and those who spread rumor in al-madinah do not cease, We will sure incit you against them; then they will not remain your neighbor therein except for a little.
33|61|accurs wherev they are found, [being] seiz and massacr completely.
33|62|[thi is] the establish way of allah with those who pass on before; and you will not find in the way of allah ani change.
33|63|peopl ask you concern the hour. say," knowledg of it is onli with allah. and what may make you perceive? perhap the hour is near."
33|64|indeed, allah ha curs the disbeliev and prepar for them a blaze.
33|65|abid therein forever, they will not find a protector or a helper.
33|66|th day their face will be turn about in the fire, they will say, "how we wish we had obey allah and obey the messenger."
33|67|and they will say, "our lord, inde we obey our master and our dignitaries, and they led us astray from the [right] way.
33|68|our lord, give them doubl the punish and curs them with a great curse."
33|69|o you who have believed, be not like those who abus moses; then allah clear him of what they said. and he, in the sight of allah, wa distinguished.
33|70|o you who have believed, fear allah and speak word of appropri justice.
33|71|h will [then] amend for you your deed and forgiv you your sins. and whoever obey allah and hi messeng ha certainli attain a great attainment.
33|72|indeed, we offer the trust to the heaven and the earth and the mountains, and they declin to bear it and fear it; but man [undertook to] bear it. indeed, he wa unjust and ignorant.
33|73|[it was] so that allah may punish the hypocrit men and hypocrit women and the men and women who associ other with him and that allah may accept repent from the believ men and believ women. and ever is allah forgiv and merciful.
34|1|[all] prais is [due] to allah, to whom belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is in the earth, and to him belong [all] prais in the hereafter. and He is the wise, the acquainted.
34|2|h know what penetr into the earth and what emerg from it and what descend from the heaven and what ascend therein. and He is the merciful, the forgiving.
34|3|but those who disbeliev say, "the hour will not come to us." say, "yes, by my lord, it will sure come to you. [allah is] the knower of the unseen." not absent from him is an atom' weight within the heaven or within the earth or [what is] smaller than that or greater, except that it is in a clear regist -
34|4|that He may reward those who believ and do righteou deeds. those will have forgiv and nobl provision.
34|5|but those who strive against our vers [seeking] to caus failur - for them will be a pain punish of foul nature.
34|6|and those who have been given knowledg see that what is reveal to you from your lord is the truth, and it guid to the path of the exalt in might, the praiseworthy.
34|7|but those who disbeliev say, "shall we direct you to a man who will inform you [that] when you have disintegr in complet disintegration, you will [then] be [recreated] in a new creation?
34|8|ha he invent about allah a lie or is there in him madness?" rather, they who do not believ in the hereaft will be in the punish and [are in] extrem error.
34|9|then, do they not look at what is befor them and what is behind them of the heaven and earth? If We should will, We could caus the earth to swallow them or [could] let fall upon them fragment from the sky. inde in that is a sign for everi servant turn back [to allah].
34|10|and We certainli gave david from Us bounty. [we said], "O mountains, repeat [our] prais with him, and the bird [a well]." and We made pliabl for him iron,
34|11|[command him], "make full coat of mail and calcul [precisely] the links, and work [all of you] righteousness. inde I, of what you do, am seeing."
34|12|and to solomon [we subjected] the wind - it morn [journey wa that of] a month - and it afternoon [journey wa that of] a month, and We made flow for him a spring of [liquid] copper. and among the jinn were those who work for him by the permiss of hi lord. and whoever deviat among them from our command - We will make him tast of the punish of the blaze.
34|13|they made for him what he will of elev chambers, statues, bowl like reservoirs, and stationari kettles. [we said], "work, O famili of david, in gratitude." and few of My servant are grateful.
34|14|and when We decre for solomon death, noth indic to the jinn hi death except a creatur of the earth eat hi staff. but when he fell, it becam clear to the jinn that if they had known the unseen, they would not have remain in humili punishment.
34|15|ther wa for [the tribe of] saba' in their dwell place a sign: two [field of] garden on the right and on the left. [they were told], "eat from the provis of your lord and be grate to him. A good land [have you], and a forgiv lord."
34|16|but they turn away [refusing], so We sent upon them the flood of the dam, and We replac their two [field of] garden with garden of bitter fruit, tamarisk and someth of spars lote trees.
34|17|[by] that We repaid them becaus they disbelieved. and do We [thus] repay except the ungrateful?
34|18|and We place between them and the citi which We had bless [many] visibl cities. and We determin between them the [distanc of] journey, [saying], "travel between them by night or day in safety."
34|19|but [insolently] they said, "our lord, lengthen the distanc between our journeys," and wrong themselves, so We made them narrat and dispers them in total dispersion. inde in that are sign for everyon patient and grateful.
34|20|and ible had alreadi confirm through them hi assumption, so they follow him, except for a parti of believers.
34|21|and he had over them no author except [it wa decreed] that We might make evid who believ in the hereaft from who is thereof in doubt. and your lord, over all things, is guardian.
34|22|say, [O muhammad], "invok those you claim [a deities] besid allah." they do not possess an atom' weight [of ability] in the heaven or on the earth, and they do not have therein ani partnership [with him], nor is there for him from among them ani assistant.
34|23|and intercess doe not benefit with him except for one whom He permits. [and those wait] until, when terror is remov from their hearts, they will say [to one another], "what ha your lord said?" they will say, "the truth." and He is the most high, the grand.
34|24|say, "who provid for you from the heaven and the earth?" say, "allah. and indeed, we or you are either upon guidanc or in clear error."
34|25|say, "you will not be ask about what we committed, and we will not be ask about what you do."
34|26|say, "our lord will bring us together; then He will judg between us in truth. and He is the know judge."
34|27|say, "show me those whom you have attach to him as partners. no! rather, He [alone] is allah, the exalt in might, the wise."
34|28|and We have not sent you except comprehens to mankind as a bringer of good tide and a warner. but most of the peopl do not know.
34|29|and they say, "when is thi promise, if you should be truthful?"
34|30|say, "for you is the appoint of a day [when] you will not remain thereaft an hour, nor will you preced [it]."
34|31|and those who disbeliev say, "we will never believ in thi qur'an nor in that befor it." but if you could see when the wrongdoer are made to stand befor their lord, refut each other' words... those who were oppress will say to those who were arrogant, "if not for you, we would have been believers."
34|32|thos who were arrog will say to those who were oppressed, "did we avert you from guidanc after it had come to you? rather, you were criminals."
34|33|thos who were oppress will say to those who were arrogant, "rather, [it wa your] conspiraci of night and day when you were order us to disbeliev in allah and attribut to him equals." but they will [all] confid regret when they see the punishment; and We will put shackl on the neck of those who disbelieved. will they be recompens except for what they use to do?
34|34|and We did not send into a citi ani warner except that it affluent said, "inde we, in that with which you were sent, are disbelievers."
34|35|and they said, "we are more [than the believers] in wealth and children, and we are not to be punished."
34|36|say, "indeed, my lord extend provis for whom He will and restrict [it], but most of the peopl do not know."
34|37|and it is not your wealth or your children that bring you nearer to Us in position, but it is [bi being] one who ha believ and done righteousness. for them there will be the doubl reward for what they did, and they will be in the upper chamber [of paradise], safe [and secure].
34|38|and the one who strive against our vers to caus [them] failur - those will be brought into the punish [to remain].
34|39|say, "indeed, my lord extend provis for whom He will of hi servant and restrict [it] for him. but whatev thing you spend [in hi cause] - He will compens it; and He is the best of providers."
34|40|and [mention] the day when He will gather them all and then say to the angels, "did these [people] use to worship you?"
34|41|they will say, "exalt are you! you, [O allah], are our benefactor not them. rather, they use to worship the jinn; most of them were believ in them."
34|42|but today you do not hold for one anoth [the power of] benefit or harm, and We will say to those who wronged, "tast the punish of the fire, which you use to deny."
34|43|and when our vers are recit to them as clear evidences, they say, "thi is not but a man who wish to avert you from that which your father were worshipping." and they say, "thi is not except a lie invented." and those who disbeliev say of the truth when it ha come to them, "thi is not but obviou magic."
34|44|and We had not given them ani scriptur which they could study, and We had not sent to them befor you, [O muhammad], ani warner.
34|45|and those befor them denied, and the peopl of makkah have not attain a tenth of what We had given them. but the former peopl deni My messengers, so how [terrible] wa My reproach.
34|46|say, "I onli advis you of one [thing] - that you stand for allah, [seek truth] in pair and individually, and then give thought." there is not in your companion ani madness. He is onli a warner to you befor a sever punishment.
34|47|say, "whatev payment I might have ask of you - it is yours. My payment is onli from allah, and He is, over all things, witness."
34|48|say, "indeed, my lord project the truth. knower of the unseen."
34|49|say, "the truth ha come, and falsehood can neither begin [anything] nor repeat [it]."
34|50|say, "if I should err, I would onli err against myself. but if I am guided, it is by what my lord reveal to me. indeed, He is hear and near."
34|51|and if you could see when they are terrifi but there is no escape, and they will be seiz from a place nearby.
34|52|and they will [then] say, "we believ in it!" but how for them will be the take [of faith] from a place far away?
34|53|and they had alreadi disbeliev in it befor and would assault the unseen from a place far away.
34|54|and prevent will be place between them and what they desire, as wa done with their kind before. indeed, they were in disquiet denial.
35|1|[all] prais is [due] to allah, creator of the heaven and the earth, [who] made the angel messeng have wings, two or three or four. He increas in creation what He wills. indeed, allah is over all thing competent.
35|2|whatev allah grant to peopl of merci - none can withhold it; and whatev He withhold - none can releas it thereafter. and He is the exalt in might, the wise.
35|3|o mankind, rememb the favor of allah upon you. Is there ani creator other than allah who provid for you from the heaven and earth? there is no deiti except him, so how are you deluded?
35|4|and if they deni you, [O muhammad] - alreadi were messeng deni befor you. and to allah are return [all] matters.
35|5|o mankind, inde the promis of allah is truth, so let not the worldli life delud you and be not deceiv about allah by the deceiver.
35|6|indeed, satan is an enemi to you; so take him as an enemy. He onli invit hi parti to be among the companion of the blaze.
35|7|thos who disbeliev will have a sever punishment, and those who believ and do righteou deed will have forgiv and great reward.
35|8|then is one to whom the evil of hi deed ha been made attract so he consid it good [like one rightli guided]? for indeed, allah send astray whom He will and guid whom He wills. So do not let yourself perish over them in regret. indeed, allah is know of what they do.
35|9|and it is allah who send the winds, and they stir the clouds, and We drive them to a dead land and give life therebi to the earth after it lifelessness. thu is the resurrection.
35|10|whoev desir honor [through power] - then to allah belong all honor. To him ascend good speech, and righteou work rais it. but they who plot evil deed will have a sever punishment, and the plot of those - it will perish.
35|11|and allah creat you from dust, then from a sperm-drop; then He made you mates. and no femal conceiv nor doe she give birth except with hi knowledge. and no age person is grant [additional] life nor is hi lifespan lessen but that it is in a register. indeed, that for allah is easy.
35|12|and not alik are the two bodi of water. one is fresh and sweet, palat for drinking, and one is salti and bitter. and from each you eat tender meat and extract ornament which you wear, and you see the ship plow through [them] that you might seek of hi bounty; and perhap you will be grateful.
35|13|h caus the night to enter the day, and He caus the day to enter the night and ha subject the sun and the moon - each run [it course] for a specifi term. that is allah, your lord; to him belong sovereignty. and those whom you invok other than him do not possess [a much as] the membran of a date seed.
35|14|if you invok them, they do not hear your supplication; and if they heard, they would not respond to you. and on the day of resurrect they will deni your association. and none can inform you like [one] acquaint [with all matters].
35|15|o mankind, you are those in need of allah, while allah is the free of need, the praiseworthy.
35|16|if He wills, He can do away with you and bring forth a new creation.
35|17|and that is for allah not difficult.
35|18|and no bearer of burden will bear the burden of another. and if a heavili laden soul call [another] to [carri some of] it load, noth of it will be carried, even if he should be a close relative. you can onli warn those who fear their lord unseen and have establish prayer. and whoever purifi himself onli purifi himself for [the benefit of] hi soul. and to allah is the [final] destination.
35|19|not equal are the blind and the seeing,
35|20|nor are the dark and the light,
35|21|nor are the shade and the heat,
35|22|and not equal are the live and the dead. indeed, allah caus to hear whom He wills, but you cannot make hear those in the graves.
35|23|you, [O muhammad], are not but a warner.
35|24|indeed, We have sent you with the truth as a bringer of good tide and a warner. and there wa no nation but that there had pass within it a warner.
35|25|and if they deni you - then alreadi have those befor them denied. their messeng came to them with clear proof and written ordin and with the enlighten scripture.
35|26|then I seiz the one who disbelieved, and how [terrible] wa My reproach.
35|27|do you not see that allah send down rain from the sky, and We produc therebi fruit of vari colors? and in the mountain are tracts, white and red of vari shade and [some] extrem black.
35|28|and among peopl and move creatur and graze livestock are variou color similarly. onli those fear allah, from among hi servants, who have knowledge. indeed, allah is exalt in might and forgiving.
35|29|indeed, those who recit the book of allah and establish prayer and spend [in hi cause] out of what We have provid them, secretli and publicly, [can] expect a profit that will never perish -
35|30|that He may give them in full their reward and increas for them of hi bounty. indeed, He is forgiv and appreciative.
35|31|and that which We have reveal to you, [O muhammad], of the book is the truth, confirm what wa befor it. indeed, allah, of hi servants, is acquaint and seeing.
35|32|then we caus to inherit the book those We have chosen of our servants; and among them is he who wrong himself, and among them is he who is moderate, and among them is he who is foremost in good deed by permiss of allah. that [inheritance] is what is the great bounty.
35|33|[for them are] garden of perpetu resid which they will enter. they will be adorn therein with bracelet of gold and pearls, and their garment therein will be silk.
35|34|and they will say, "prais to allah, who ha remov from us [all] sorrow. indeed, our lord is forgiv and appreci -
35|35|he who ha settl us in the home of durat out of hi bounty. there touch us not in it ani fatigue, and there touch us not in it weari [of mind]."
35|36|and for those who disbeliev will be the fire of hell. [death] is not decre for them so they may die, nor will it torment be lighten for them. thu do we recompens everi ungrat one.
35|37|and they will cri out therein, "our lord, remov us; we will do righteous - other than what we were doing!" but did We not grant you life enough for whoever would rememb therein to remember, and the warner had come to you? So tast [the punishment], for there is not for the wrongdoer ani helper.
35|38|indeed, allah is knower of the unseen [aspects] of the heaven and earth. indeed, He is know of that within the breasts.
35|39|it is He who ha made you successor upon the earth. and whoever disbeliev - upon him will be [the consequ of] hi disbelief. and the disbelief of the disbeliev doe not increas them in the sight of their lord except in hatred; and the disbelief of the disbeliev doe not increas them except in loss.
35|40|say, "have you consid your 'partners' whom you invok besid allah? show me what they have creat from the earth, or have they partnership [with him] in the heavens? Or have We given them a book so they are [standing] on evid therefrom? [no], rather, the wrongdoer do not promis each other except delusion."
35|41|indeed, allah hold the heaven and the earth, lest they cease. and if they should cease, no one could hold them [in place] after him. indeed, He is forbear and forgiving.
35|42|and they swore by allah their strongest oath that if a warner came to them, they would be more guid than [any] one of the [previous] nations. but when a warner came to them, it did not increas them except in aversion.
35|43|[du to] arrog in the land and plot of evil; but the evil plot doe not encompass except it own people. then do they await except the way of the former peoples? but you will never find in the way of allah ani change, and you will never find in the way of allah ani alteration.
35|44|hav they not travel through the land and observ how wa the end of those befor them? and they were greater than them in power. but allah is not to be caus failur by anyth in the heaven or on the earth. indeed, He is ever know and competent.
35|45|and if allah were to impos blame on the peopl for what they have earned, He would not leav upon the earth ani creature. but He defer them for a specifi term. and when their time comes, then inde allah ha ever been, of hi servants, seeing.
36|1|ya, seen.
36|2|bi the wise qur'an.
36|3|inde you, [O muhammad], are from among the messengers,
36|4|on a straight path.
36|5|[thi is] a revel of the exalt in might, the merciful,
36|6|that you may warn a peopl whose forefath were not warned, so they are unaware.
36|7|alreadi the word ha come into effect upon most of them, so they do not believe.
36|8|indeed, We have put shackl on their necks, and they are to their chins, so they are with head [kept] aloft.
36|9|and We have put befor them a barrier and behind them a barrier and cover them, so they do not see.
36|10|and it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe.
36|11|y can onli warn one who follow the messag and fear the most merci unseen. So give him good tide of forgiv and nobl reward.
36|12|indeed, it is We who bring the dead to life and record what they have put forth and what they left behind, and all thing We have enumer in a clear register.
36|13|and present to them an example: the peopl of the city, when the messeng came to it -
36|14|when We sent to them two but they deni them, so We strengthen them with a third, and they said, "indeed, we are messeng to you."
36|15|they said, "you are not but human be like us, and the most merci ha not reveal a thing. you are onli tell lies."
36|16|they said, "our lord know that we are messeng to you,
36|17|and we are not respons except for clear notification."
36|18|they said, "indeed, we consid you a bad omen. If you do not desist, we will sure stone you, and there will sure touch you, from us, a pain punishment."
36|19|they said, "your omen is with yourselves. Is it becaus you were reminded? rather, you are a transgress people."
36|20|and there came from the farthest end of the citi a man, running. He said, "O my people, follow the messengers.
36|21|follow those who do not ask of you [any] payment, and they are [rightly] guided.
36|22|and whi should I not worship He who creat me and to whom you will be returned?
36|23|should I take other than him [false] deiti [while], if the most merci intend for me some adversity, their intercess will not avail me at all, nor can they save me?
36|24|indeed, I would then be in manifest error.
36|25|indeed, I have believ in your lord, so listen to me."
36|26|it wa said, "enter paradise." He said, "I wish my peopl could know
36|27|of how my lord ha forgiven me and place me among the honored."
36|28|and We did not send down upon hi peopl after him ani soldier from the heaven, nor would We have done so.
36|29|it wa not but one shout, and immedi they were extinguished.
36|30|how regret for the servants. there did not come to them ani messeng except that they use to ridicul him.
36|31|hav they not consid how mani gener We destroy befor them - that they to them will not return?
36|32|and indeed, all of them will yet be brought present befor us.
36|33|and a sign for them is the dead earth. We have brought it to life and brought forth from it grain, and from it they eat.
36|34|and We place therein garden of palm tree and grapevin and caus to burst forth therefrom some spring -
36|35|that they may eat of hi fruit. and their hand have not produc it, so will they not be grateful?
36|36|exalt is He who creat all pair - from what the earth grow and from themselv and from that which they do not know.
36|37|and a sign for them is the night. We remov from it [the light of] day, so they are [left] in darkness.
36|38|and the sun run [on course] toward it stop point. that is the determin of the exalt in might, the knowing.
36|39|and the moon - We have determin for it phases, until it return [appearing] like the old date stalk.
36|40|it is not allow for the sun to reach the moon, nor doe the night overtak the day, but each, in an orbit, is swimming.
36|41|and a sign for them is that We carri their forefath in a laden ship.
36|42|and We creat for them from the like of it that which they ride.
36|43|and if We should will, We could drown them; then no one respond to a cri would there be for them, nor would they be saved
36|44|except as a merci from Us and provis for a time.
36|45|but when it is said to them, "bewar of what is befor you and what is behind you; perhap you will receiv mercy... "
36|46|and no sign come to them from the sign of their lord except that they are from it turn away.
36|47|and when it is said to them, "spend from that which allah ha provid for you," those who disbeliev say to those who believe, "should we feed one whom, if allah had willed, He would have fed? you are not but in clear error."
36|48|and they say, "when is thi promise, if you should be truthful?"
36|49|they do not await except one blast which will seiz them while they are disputing.
36|50|and they will not be abl [to give] ani instruction, nor to their peopl can they return.
36|51|and the horn will be blown; and at onc from the grave to their lord they will hasten.
36|52|they will say, "O woe to us! who ha rais us up from our sleep place?" [the repli will be], "thi is what the most merci had promised, and the messeng told the truth."
36|53|it will not be but one blast, and at onc they are all brought present befor us.
36|54|so today no soul will be wrong at all, and you will not be recompens except for what you use to do.
36|55|inde the companion of paradise, that day, will be amus in [joyful] occup -
36|56|they and their spous - in shade, reclin on adorn couches.
36|57|for them therein is fruit, and for them is whatev they request [or wish]
36|58|[and] "peace," a word from a merci lord.
36|59|[then He will say], "but stand apart today, you criminals.
36|60|did I not enjoin upon you, O children of adam, that you not worship satan - [for] indeed, he is to you a clear enemi -
36|61|and that you worship [only] me? thi is a straight path.
36|62|and he had alreadi led astray from among you much of creation, so did you not use reason?
36|63|thi is the hellfir which you were promised.
36|64|[ent to] burn therein today for what you use to deny."
36|65|that day, We will seal over their mouths, and their hand will speak to us, and their feet will testifi about what they use to earn.
36|66|and if We willed, We could have obliter their eyes, and they would race to [find] the path, and how could they see?
36|67|and if We willed, We could have deform them, [paralyz them] in their place so they would not be abl to proceed, nor could they return.
36|68|and he to whom We grant long life We revers in creation; so will they not understand?
36|69|and We did not give prophet muhammad, knowledg of poetry, nor is it befit for him. It is not but a messag and a clear qur'an
36|70|to warn whoever is aliv and justifi the word against the disbelievers.
36|71|do they not see that We have creat for them from what our hand have made, graze livestock, and [then] they are their owners?
36|72|and We have tame them for them, so some of them they ride, and some of them they eat.
36|73|and for them therein are [other] benefit and drinks, so will they not be grateful?
36|74|but they have taken besid allah [false] deiti that perhap they would be helped.
36|75|they are not abl to help them, and they [themselves] are for them soldier in attendance.
36|76|so let not their speech griev you. indeed, We know what they conceal and what they declare.
36|77|do man not consid that We creat him from a [mere] sperm-drop - then at onc he is a clear adversary?
36|78|and he present for Us an exampl and forget hi [own] creation. He says, "who will give life to bone while they are disintegrated?"
36|79|say, "he will give them life who produc them the first time; and He is, of all creation, knowing."
36|80|[it is] He who made for you from the green tree, fire, and then from it you ignite.
36|81|i not He who creat the heaven and the earth abl to creat the like of them? yes, [it is so]; and He is the know creator.
36|82|hi command is onli when He intend a thing that He say to it, "be," and it is.
36|83|so exalt is He in whose hand is the realm of all things, and to him you will be returned.
37|1|bi those [angels] line up in rows
37|2|and those who drive [the clouds]
37|3|and those who recit the message,
37|4|indeed, your god is one,
37|5|lord of the heaven and the earth and that between them and lord of the sunrises.
37|6|indeed, We have adorn the nearest heaven with an adorn of stars
37|7|and as protect against everi rebelli devil
37|8|[so] they may not listen to the exalt assembl [of angels] and are pelt from everi side,
37|9|repelled; and for them is a constant punishment,
37|10|except one who snatch [some words] by theft, but they are pursu by a burn flame, pierc [in brightness].
37|11|then inquir of them, [O muhammad], "are they a stronger [or more difficult] creation or those [others] We have created?" indeed, We creat men from sticki clay.
37|12|but you wonder, while they mock,
37|13|and when they are reminded, they rememb not.
37|14|and when they see a sign, they ridicule
37|15|and say, "thi is not but obviou magic.
37|16|when we have die and becom dust and bones, are we inde to be resurrected?
37|17|and our forefath [a well]?"
37|18|say, "yes, and you will be [rendered] contemptible."
37|19|it will be onli one shout, and at onc they will be observing.
37|20|they will say, "O woe to us! thi is the day of recompense."
37|21|[they will be told], "thi is the day of judgement which you use to deny."
37|22|[th angel will be ordered], "gather those who commit wrong, their kinds, and what they use to worship
37|23|oth than allah, and guid them to the path of hellfire
37|24|and stop them; indeed, they are to be questioned."
37|25|[they will be asked], "what is [wrong] with you? whi do you not help each other?"
37|26|but they, that day, are in surrender.
37|27|and they will approach one anoth blame each other.
37|28|they will say, "indeed, you use to come at us from the right."
37|29|th oppressor will say, "rather, you [yourselves] were not believers,
37|30|and we had over you no authority, but you were a transgress people.
37|31|so the word of our lord ha come into effect upon us; indeed, we will tast [punishment].
37|32|and we led you to deviation; indeed, we were deviators."
37|33|so inde they, that day, will be share in the punishment.
37|34|indeed, that is how We deal with the criminals.
37|35|inde they, when it wa said to them, "there is no deiti but allah," were arrogant
37|36|and were saying, "are we to leav our god for a mad poet?"
37|37|rather, the prophet ha come with the truth and confirm the [previous] messengers.
37|38|indeed, you [disbelievers] will be taster of the pain punishment,
37|39|and you will not be recompens except for what you use to do -
37|40|but not the chosen servant of allah.
37|41|thos will have a provis determin -
37|42|fruits; and they will be honored
37|43|in garden of pleasure
37|44|on throne face one another.
37|45|ther will be circul among them a cup [of wine] from a flow spring,
37|46|whit and delici to the drinkers;
37|47|no bad effect is there in it, nor from it will they be intoxicated.
37|48|and with them will be women limit [their] glances, with large, [beautiful] eyes,
37|49|a if they were [delicate] eggs, well-protected.
37|50|and they will approach one another, inquir of each other.
37|51|a speaker among them will say, "indeed, I had a companion [on earth]
37|52|who would say, 'are you inde of those who believe
37|53|that when we have die and becom dust and bones, we will inde be recompensed?'"
37|54|h will say, "would you [care to] look?"
37|55|and he will look and see him in the midst of the hellfire.
37|56|h will say, "bi allah, you almost ruin me.
37|57|if not for the favor of my lord, I would have been of those brought in [to hell].
37|58|then, are we not to die
37|59|except for our first death, and we will not be punished?"
37|60|indeed, thi is the great attainment.
37|61|for the like of thi let the worker [on earth] work.
37|62|i paradis a better accommod or the tree of zaqqum?
37|63|indeed, We have made it a torment for the wrongdoers.
37|64|indeed, it is a tree issu from the bottom of the hellfire,
37|65|it emerg fruit as if it wa head of the devils.
37|66|and indeed, they will eat from it and fill with it their bellies.
37|67|then indeed, they will have after it a mixtur of scald water.
37|68|then indeed, their return will be to the hellfire.
37|69|inde they found their father astray.
37|70|so they hasten [to follow] in their footsteps.
37|71|and there had alreadi stray befor them most of the former peoples,
37|72|and We had alreadi sent among them warners.
37|73|then look how wa the end of those who were warn -
37|74|but not the chosen servant of allah.
37|75|and noah had certainli call us, and [we are] the best of responders.
37|76|and We save him and hi famili from the great affliction.
37|77|and We made hi descend those remain [on the earth]
37|78|and left for him [favor mention] among later generations:
37|79|"peac upon noah among the worlds."
37|80|indeed, We thu reward the doer of good.
37|81|indeed, he wa of our believ servants.
37|82|then We drown the disbelievers.
37|83|and indeed, among hi kind wa abraham,
37|84|when he came to hi lord with a sound heart
37|85|[and] when he said to hi father and hi people, "what do you worship?
37|86|i it falsehood [as] god other than allah you desire?
37|87|then what is your thought about the lord of the worlds?"
37|88|and he cast a look at the stars
37|89|and said, "indeed, I am [about to be] ill."
37|90|so they turn away from him, departing.
37|91|then he turn to their god and said, "do you not eat?
37|92|what is [wrong] with you that you do not speak?"
37|93|and he turn upon them a blow with [his] right hand.
37|94|then the peopl came toward him, hastening.
37|95|h said, "do you worship that which you [yourselves] carve,
37|96|whil allah creat you and that which you do?"
37|97|they said, "construct for him a furnac and throw him into the burn fire."
37|98|and they intend for him a plan, but We made them the most debased.
37|99|and [then] he said, "indeed, I will go to [where I am order by] my lord; He will guid me.
37|100|mi lord, grant me [a child] from among the righteous."
37|101|so We gave him good tide of a forbear boy.
37|102|and when he reach with him [the age of] exertion, he said, "O my son, inde I have seen in a dream that I [must] sacrific you, so see what you think." He said, "O my father, do as you are commanded. you will find me, if allah wills, of the steadfast."
37|103|and when they had both submit and he put him down upon hi forehead,
37|104|w call to him, "O abraham,
37|105|y have fulfil the vision." indeed, We thu reward the doer of good.
37|106|indeed, thi wa the clear trial.
37|107|and We ransom him with a great sacrifice,
37|108|and We left for him [favor mention] among later generations:
37|109|"peac upon abraham."
37|110|indeed, We thu reward the doer of good.
37|111|indeed, he wa of our believ servants.
37|112|and We gave him good tide of isaac, a prophet from among the righteous.
37|113|and We bless him and isaac. but among their descend is the doer of good and the clearli unjust to himself.
37|114|and We did certainli confer favor upon mose and aaron.
37|115|and We save them and their peopl from the great affliction,
37|116|and We support them so it wa they who overcame.
37|117|and We gave them the explicit scripture,
37|118|and We guid them on the straight path.
37|119|and We left for them [favor mention] among later generations:
37|120|"peac upon mose and aaron."
37|121|indeed, We thu reward the doer of good.
37|122|indeed, they were of our believ servants.
37|123|and indeed, elia wa from among the messengers,
37|124|when he said to hi people, "will you not fear allah?
37|125|do you call upon ba'l and leav the best of creator -
37|126|allah, your lord and the lord of your first forefathers?"
37|127|and they deni him, so indeed, they will be brought [for punishment],
37|128|except the chosen servant of allah.
37|129|and We left for him [favor mention] among later generations:
37|130|"peac upon elias."
37|131|indeed, We thu reward the doer of good.
37|132|indeed, he wa of our believ servants.
37|133|and indeed, lot wa among the messengers.
37|134|[so mention] when We save him and hi family, all,
37|135|except hi wife among those who remain [with the evildoers].
37|136|then We destroy the others.
37|137|and indeed, you pass by them in the morning
37|138|and at night. then will you not use reason?
37|139|and indeed, jonah wa among the messengers.
37|140|[mention] when he ran away to the laden ship.
37|141|and he drew lot and wa among the losers.
37|142|then the fish swallow him, while he wa blameworthy.
37|143|and had he not been of those who exalt allah,
37|144|h would have remain insid it belli until the day they are resurrected.
37|145|but We threw him onto the open shore while he wa ill.
37|146|and We caus to grow over him a gourd vine.
37|147|and We sent him to [hi peopl of] a hundr thousand or more.
37|148|and they believed, so We gave them enjoy [of life] for a time.
37|149|so inquir of them, [O muhammad], "doe your lord have daughter while they have sons?
37|150|or did We creat the angel as femal while they were witnesses?"
37|151|unquestionably, it is out of their [invented] falsehood that they say,
37|152|" allah ha begotten," and indeed, they are liars.
37|153|ha He chosen daughter over sons?
37|154|what is [wrong] with you? how do you make judgement?
37|155|then will you not be reminded?
37|156|or do you have a clear authority?
37|157|then produc your scripture, if you should be truthful.
37|158|and they have claim between him and the jinn a lineage, but the jinn have alreadi known that they [who made such claims] will be brought to [punishment].
37|159|exalt is allah abov what they describe,
37|160|except the chosen servant of allah [who do not share in that sin].
37|161|so indeed, you [disbelievers] and whatev you worship,
37|162|y cannot tempt [anyone] away from him
37|163|except he who is to [enter and] burn in the hellfire.
37|164|[th angel say], "there is not among us ani except that he ha a known position.
37|165|and indeed, we are those who line up [for prayer].
37|166|and indeed, we are those who exalt allah."
37|167|and indeed, the disbeliev use to say,
37|168|"if we had a messag from [those of] the former peoples,
37|169|w would have been the chosen servant of allah."
37|170|but they disbeliev in it, so they are go to know.
37|171|and our word ha alreadi preced for our servants, the messengers,
37|172|[that] indeed, they would be those given victory
37|173|and [that] indeed, our soldier will be those who overcome.
37|174|so, [O muhammad], leav them for a time.
37|175|and see [what will befall] them, for they are go to see.
37|176|then for our punish are they impatient?
37|177|but when it descend in their territory, then evil is the morn of those who were warned.
37|178|and leav them for a time.

37|181|and peac upon the messengers.
37|182|and prais to allah, lord of the worlds.
38|1|sad. By the qur'an contain reminder...
38|2|but those who disbeliev are in pride and dissension.
38|3|how mani a gener have We destroy befor them, and they [then] call out; but it wa not a time for escape.
38|4|and they wonder that there ha come to them a warner from among themselves. and the disbeliev say, "thi is a magician and a liar.
38|5|ha he made the god [only] one god? indeed, thi is a curiou thing."
38|6|and the emin among them went forth, [saying], "continue, and be patient over [the defens of] your gods. indeed, thi is a thing intended.
38|7|w have not heard of thi in the latest religion. thi is not but a fabrication.
38|8|ha the messag been reveal to him out of [all of] us?" rather, they are in doubt about My message. rather, they have not yet tast My punishment.
38|9|or do they have the depositori of the merci of your lord, the exalt in might, the bestower?
38|10|or is their the dominion of the heaven and the earth and what is between them? then let them ascend through [any] way of access.
38|11|[they are but] soldier [who will be] defeat there among the compani [of disbelievers].
38|12|th peopl of noah deni befor them, and [the tribe of] 'aad and pharaoh, the owner of stakes,
38|13|and [the tribe of] thamud and the peopl of lot and the companion of the thicket. those are the companies.
38|14|each of them deni the messengers, so My penalti wa justified.
38|15|and these [disbelievers] await not but one blast [of the horn]; for it there will be no delay.
38|16|and they say, "our lord, hasten for us our share [of the punishment] befor the day of account"
38|17|b patient over what they say and rememb our servant, david, the possessor of strength; indeed, he wa one who repeatedli turn back [to allah].
38|18|indeed, We subject the mountain [to praise] with him, exalt [allah] in the [late] afternoon and [after] sunrise.
38|19|and the bird were assembled, all with him repeat [praises].
38|20|and We strengthen hi kingdom and gave him wisdom and discern in speech.
38|21|and ha there come to you the news of the adversaries, when they climb over the wall of [his] prayer chamber -
38|22|when they enter upon david and he wa alarm by them? they said, "fear not. [we are] two adversaries, one of whom ha wrong the other, so judg between us with truth and do not exceed [it] and guid us to the sound path.
38|23|inde this, my brother, ha ninety-nin ewes, and I have one ewe; so he said, 'entrust her to me,' and he overpow me in speech."
38|24|[david] said, "he ha certainli wrong you in demand your ewe [in addition] to hi ewes. and indeed, mani associ oppress one another, except for those who believ and do righteou deed - and few are they." and david becam certain that We had tri him, and he ask forgiv of hi lord and fell down bow [in prostration] and turn in repent [to allah].
38|25|so We forgav him that; and indeed, for him is near to Us and a good place of return.
38|26|[w said], "O david, inde We have made you a successor upon the earth, so judg between the peopl in truth and do not follow [your own] desire, as it will lead you astray from the way of allah." indeed, those who go astray from the way of allah will have a sever punish for have forgotten the day of account.
38|27|and We did not creat the heaven and the earth and that between them aimlessly. that is the assumpt of those who disbelieve, so woe to those who disbeliev from the fire.
38|28|or should we treat those who believ and do righteou deed like corrupt in the land? Or should We treat those who fear allah like the wicked?
38|29|[thi is] a bless book which We have reveal to you, [O muhammad], that they might reflect upon it vers and that those of understand would be reminded.
38|30|and to david We gave solomon. An excel servant, inde he wa one repeatedli turn back [to allah].
38|31|[mention] when there were exhibit befor him in the afternoon the pois [standing] racehorses.
38|32|and he said, "indeed, I gave prefer to the love of good [things] over the remembr of my lord until the sun disappear into the curtain [of darkness]."
38|33|[h said], "return them to me," and set about strike [their] leg and necks.
38|34|and We certainli tri solomon and place on hi throne a body; then he returned.
38|35|h said, "mi lord, forgiv me and grant me a kingdom such as will not belong to anyon after me. indeed, you are the bestower."
38|36|so We subject to him the wind blow by hi command, gently, wherev he directed,
38|37|and [also] the devil [of jinn] - everi builder and diver
38|38|and other bound togeth in shackles.
38|39|[w said], "thi is our gift, so grant or withhold without account."
38|40|and indeed, for him is near to Us and a good place of return.
38|41|and rememb our servant job, when he call to hi lord, "indeed, satan ha touch me with hardship and torment."
38|42|[so he wa told], "strike [the ground] with your foot; thi is a [spring for] a cool bath and drink."
38|43|and We grant him hi famili and a like [number] with them as merci from Us and a remind for those of understanding.
38|44|[w said], "and take in your hand a bunch [of grass] and strike with it and do not break your oath." indeed, We found him patient, an excel servant. indeed, he wa one repeatedli turn back [to allah].
38|45|and rememb our servants, abraham, isaac and jacob - those of strength and [religious] vision.
38|46|indeed, We chose them for an exclus quality: remembr of the home [of the hereafter].
38|47|and inde they are, to us, among the chosen and outstanding.
38|48|and rememb ishmael, elisha and dhul-kifl, and all are among the outstanding.
38|49|thi is a reminder. and indeed, for the righteou is a good place of return
38|50|garden of perpetu residence, whose door will be open to them.
38|51|reclin within them, they will call therein for abund fruit and drink.
38|52|and with them will be women limit [their] glanc and of equal age.
38|53|thi is what you, [the righteous], are promis for the day of account.
38|54|indeed, thi is our provision; for it there is no depletion.
38|55|thi [i so]. but indeed, for the transgressor is an evil place of return -
38|56|hell, which they will [enter to] burn, and wretch is the rest place.
38|57|thi - so let them tast it - is scald water and [foul] purulence.
38|58|and other [punishments] of it type [in various] kinds.
38|59|[it inhabit will say], "thi is a compani burst in with you. No welcom for them. indeed, they will burn in the fire."
38|60|they will say, "nor you! No welcom for you. you, [our leaders], brought thi upon us, and wretch is the settlement."
38|61|they will say, "our lord, whoever brought thi upon us - increas for him doubl punish in the fire."
38|62|and they will say, "whi do we not see men whom we use to count among the worst?
38|63|i it [because] we took them in ridicule, or ha [our] vision turn away from them?"
38|64|indeed, that is truth - the quarrel of the peopl of the fire.
38|65|say, [O muhammad], "I am onli a warner, and there is not ani deiti except allah, the one, the prevailing.
38|66|lord of the heaven and the earth and whatev is between them, the exalt in might, the perpetu forgiver."
38|67|say, "it is great news
38|68|from which you turn away.
38|69|i had no knowledg of the exalt assembl [of angels] when they were disput [the creation of adam].
38|70|it ha not been reveal to me except that I am a clear warner."
38|71|[so mention] when your lord said to the angels, "indeed, I am go to creat a human be from clay.
38|72|so when I have proport him and breath into him of My [created] soul, then fall down to him in prostration."
38|73|so the angel prostrat - all of them entirely.
38|74|except iblees; he wa arrog and becam among the disbelievers.
38|75|[allah] said, "O iblees, what prevent you from prostrat to that which I creat with My hands? were you arrog [then], or were you [already] among the haughty?"
38|76|h said, "I am better than him. you creat me from fire and creat him from clay."
38|77|[allah] said, "then get out of paradise, for indeed, you are expelled.
38|78|and indeed, upon you is My curs until the day of recompense."
38|79|h said, "mi lord, then repriev me until the day they are resurrected."
38|80|[allah] said, "so indeed, you are of those reprieved
38|81|until the day of the time well-known."
38|82|[iblees] said, "bi your might, I will sure mislead them all
38|83|except, among them, your chosen servants."
38|84|[allah] said, "the truth [i My oath], and the truth I say -
38|85|[that] I will sure fill hell with you and those of them that follow you all together."
38|86|say, [O muhammad], "I do not ask you for the qur'an ani payment, and I am not of the pretentious
38|87|it is but a remind to the worlds.
38|88|and you will sure know [the truth of] it inform after a time."
39|1|th revel of the qur'an is from allah, the exalt in might, the wise.
39|2|indeed, We have sent down to you the book, [O muhammad], in truth. So worship allah, [being] sincer to him in religion.
39|3|unquestionably, for allah is the pure religion. and those who take protector besid him [say], "we onli worship them that they may bring us nearer to allah in position." indeed, allah will judg between them concern that over which they differ. indeed, allah doe not guid he who is a liar and [confirmed] disbeliever.
39|4|if allah had intend to take a son, He could have chosen from what He creat whatev He willed. exalt is he; He is allah, the one, the prevailing.
39|5|h creat the heaven and earth in truth. He wrap the night over the day and wrap the day over the night and ha subject the sun and the moon, each run [it course] for a specifi term. unquestionably, He is the exalt in might, the perpetu forgiver.
39|6|h creat you from one soul. then He made from it it mate, and He produc for you from the graze livestock eight mates. He creat you in the womb of your mothers, creation after creation, within three darknesses. that is allah, your lord; to him belong dominion. there is no deiti except him, so how are you averted?
39|7|if you disbeliev - indeed, allah is free from need of you. and He doe not approv for hi servant disbelief. and if you are grateful, He approv it for you; and no bearer of burden will bear the burden of another. then to your lord is your return, and He will inform you about what you use to do. indeed, He is know of that within the breasts.
39|8|and when advers touch man, he call upon hi lord, turn to him [alone]; then when He bestow on him a favor from himself, he forget him whom he call upon before, and he attribut to allah equal to mislead [people] from hi way. say, "enjoy your disbelief for a little; indeed, you are of the companion of the fire."
39|9|i one who is devoutli obedi dure period of the night, prostrat and stand [in prayer], fear the hereaft and hope for the merci of hi lord, [like one who doe not]? say, "are those who know equal to those who do not know?" onli they will rememb [who are] peopl of understanding.
39|10|say, "O My servant who have believed, fear your lord. for those who do good in thi world is good, and the earth of allah is spacious. indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account."
39|11|say, [O muhammad], "indeed, I have been command to worship allah, [being] sincer to him in religion.
39|12|and I have been command to be the first [among you] of the muslims."
39|13|say, "inde I fear, if I should disobey my lord, the punish of a tremend day."
39|14|say, "allah [alone] do I worship, sincer to him in my religion,
39|15|so worship what you will besid him." say, "indeed, the loser are the one who will lose themselv and their famili on the day of resurrection. unquestionably, that is the manifest loss."
39|16|they will have canopi of fire abov them and below them, canopies. By that allah threaten hi servants. O My servants, then fear me.
39|17|but those who have avoid taghut, lest they worship it, and turn back to allah - for them are good tidings. So give good tide to My servants
39|18|who listen to speech and follow the best of it. those are the one allah ha guided, and those are peopl of understanding.
39|19|then, is one who ha deserv the decre of punish [to be guided]? then, can you save one who is in the fire?
39|20|but those who have fear their lord - for them are chambers, abov them chamber built high, beneath which river flow. [thi is] the promis of allah. allah doe not fail in [his] promise.
39|21|do you not see that allah send down rain from the sky and make it flow as spring [and rivers] in the earth; then He produc therebi crop of vari colors; then they dri and you see them turn yellow; then He make them [scattered] debris. inde in that is a remind for those of understanding.
39|22|so is one whose breast allah ha expand to [accept] islam and he is upon a light from hi lord [like one whose heart reject it]? then woe to those whose heart are harden against the remembr of allah. those are in manifest error.
39|23|allah ha sent down the best statement: a consist book wherein is reiteration. the skin shiver therefrom of those who fear their lord; then their skin and their heart relax at the remembr of allah. that is the guidanc of allah by which He guid whom He wills. and one whom allah leav astray - for him there is no guide.
39|24|then is he who will shield with hi face the worst of the punish on the day of resurrect [like one secur from it]? and it will be said to the wrongdoers, "tast what you use to earn."
39|25|thos befor them denied, and punish came upon them from where they did not perceive.
39|26|so allah made them tast disgrac in worldli life. but the punish of the hereaft is greater, if they onli knew.
39|27|and We have certainli present for the peopl in thi qur'an from everi [kind of] exampl - that they might remember.
39|28|[it is] an arab qur'an, without ani devianc that they might becom righteous.
39|29|allah present an example: a slave own by quarrel partner and anoth belong exclus to one man - are they equal in comparison? prais be to allah! but most of them do not know.
39|30|indeed, you are to die, and indeed, they are to die.
39|31|then inde you, on the day of resurrection, befor your lord, will dispute.
39|32|so who is more unjust than one who lie about allah and deni the truth when it ha come to him? Is there not in hell a resid for the disbelievers?
39|33|and the one who ha brought the truth and [they who] believ in it - those are the righteous.
39|34|they will have whatev they desir with their lord. that is the reward of the doer of good -
39|35|that allah may remov from them the worst of what they did and reward them their due for the best of what they use to do.
39|36|i not allah suffici for hi servant [prophet muhammad]? and [yet], they threaten you with those [they worship] other than him. and whoever allah leav astray - for him there is no guide.
39|37|and whoever allah guid - for him there is no misleader. Is not allah exalt in might and owner of retribution?
39|38|and if you ask them, "who creat the heaven and the earth?" they would sure say, "allah." say, "then have you consid what you invok besid allah? If allah intend me harm, are they remov of hi harm; or if He intend me mercy, are they withhold of hi mercy?" say, "suffici for me is allah; upon him [alone] reli the [wise] reliers."
39|39|say, "O my people, work accord to your position, [for] indeed, I am working; and you are go to know
39|40|to whom will come a torment disgrac him and on whom will descend an endur punishment."
39|41|indeed, We sent down to you the book for the peopl in truth. So whoever is guid - it is for [the benefit of] hi soul; and whoever goe astray onli goe astray to it detriment. and you are not a manag over them.
39|42|allah take the soul at the time of their death, and those that do not die [he takes] dure their sleep. then He keep those for which He ha decre death and releas the other for a specifi term. inde in that are sign for a peopl who give thought.
39|43|or have they taken other than allah as intercessors? say, "even though they do not possess [power over] anything, nor do they reason?"
39|44|say, "to allah belong [the right to allow] intercess entirely. To him belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth. then to him you will be returned."
39|45|and when allah is mention alone, the heart of those who do not believ in the hereaft shrink with aversion, but when those [worshipped] other than him are mentioned, immedi they rejoice.
39|46|say, "O allah, creator of the heaven and the earth, knower of the unseen and the witnessed, you will judg between your servant concern that over which they use to differ."
39|47|and if those who did wrong had all that is in the earth entir and the like of it with it, they would [attempt to] ransom themselv therebi from the worst of the punish on the day of resurrection. and there will appear to them from allah that which they had not taken into account.
39|48|and there will appear to them the evil they had earned, and they will be envelop by what they use to ridicule.
39|49|and when advers touch man, he call upon us; then when We bestow on him a favor from us, he says, "I have onli been given it becaus of [my] knowledge." rather, it is a trial, but most of them do not know.
39|50|thos befor them had alreadi said it, but they were not avail by what they use to earn.
39|51|and the evil consequ of what they earn struck them. and those who have wrong of these [people] will be afflict by the evil consequ of what they earned; and they will not caus failure.
39|52|do they not know that allah extend provis for whom He will and restrict [it]? inde in that are sign for a peopl who believe.
39|53|say, "O My servant who have transgress against themselv [bi sinning], do not despair of the merci of allah. indeed, allah forgiv all sins. indeed, it is He who is the forgiving, the merciful."
39|54|and return [in repentance] to your lord and submit to him befor the punish come upon you; then you will not be helped.
39|55|and follow the best of what wa reveal to you from your lord befor the punish come upon you suddenli while you do not perceive,
39|56|lest a soul should say, "oh [how great is] my regret over what I neglect in regard to allah and that I wa among the mockers."
39|57|or [lest] it say, "if onli allah had guid me, I would have been among the righteous."
39|58|or [lest] it say when it see the punishment, "if onli I had anoth turn so I could be among the doer of good."
39|59|but yes, there had come to you My verses, but you deni them and were arrogant, and you were among the disbelievers.
39|60|and on the day of resurrect you will see those who lie about allah [with] their face blackened. Is there not in hell a resid for the arrogant?
39|61|and allah will save those who fear him by their attainment; no evil will touch them, nor will they grieve.
39|62|allah is the creator of all things, and He is, over all things, dispos of affairs.
39|63|to him belong the key of the heaven and the earth. and they who disbeliev in the vers of allah - it is those who are the losers.
39|64|say, [O muhammad], "i it other than allah that you order me to worship, O ignor ones?"
39|65|and it wa alreadi reveal to you and to those befor you that if you should associ [anything] with allah, your work would sure becom worthless, and you would sure be among the losers."
39|66|rather, worship [only] allah and be among the grateful.
39|67|they have not apprais allah with true appraisal, while the earth entir will be [within] hi grip on the day of resurrection, and the heaven will be fold in hi right hand. exalt is He and high abov what they associ with him.
39|68|and the horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heaven and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom allah wills. then it will be blown again, and at onc they will be standing, look on.
39|69|and the earth will shine with the light of it lord, and the record [of deeds] will be placed, and the prophet and the wit will be brought, and it will be judg between them in truth, and they will not be wronged.
39|70|and everi soul will be fulli compens [for] what it did; and He is most know of what they do.
39|71|and those who disbeliev will be driven to hell in group until, when they reach it, it gate are open and it keeper will say, "did there not come to you messeng from yourselves, recit to you the vers of your lord and warn you of the meet of thi day of yours?" they will say, "yes, but the word of punish ha come into effect upon the disbelievers.
39|72|[to them] it will be said, "enter the gate of hell to abid etern therein, and wretch is the resid of the arrogant."
39|73|but those who fear their lord will be driven to paradis in group until, when they reach it while it gate have been open and it keeper say, "peac be upon you; you have becom pure; so enter it to abid etern therein," [they will enter].
39|74|and they will say, "prais to allah, who ha fulfil for us hi promis and made us inherit the earth [so] we may settl in paradis wherev we will. and excel is the reward of [righteous] workers."
39|75|and you will see the angel surround the throne, exalt [allah] with prais of their lord. and it will be judg between them in truth, and it will be said, "[all] prais to allah, lord of the worlds."
40|1|ha, meem.
40|2|th revel of the book is from allah, the exalt in might, the knowing.
40|3|th forgiv of sin, acceptor of repentance, sever in punishment, owner of abundance. there is no deiti except him; to him is the destination.
40|4|no one disput concern the sign of allah except those who disbelieve, so be not deceiv by their [uninhibited] movement throughout the land.
40|5|th peopl of noah deni befor them and the [disbelieving] faction after them, and everi nation intend [a plot] for their messeng to seiz him, and they disput by [using] falsehood to [attempt to] invalid therebi the truth. So I seiz them, and how [terrible] wa My penalty.
40|6|and thu ha the word of your lord come into effect upon those who disbeliev that they are companion of the fire.
40|7|thos [angels] who carri the throne and those around it exalt [allah] with prais of their lord and believ in him and ask forgiv for those who have believed, [saying], "our lord, you have encompass all thing in merci and knowledge, so forgiv those who have repent and follow your way and protect them from the punish of hellfire.
40|8|our lord, and admit them to garden of perpetu resid which you have promis them and whoever wa righteou among their fathers, their spous and their offspring. indeed, it is you who is the exalt in might, the wise.
40|9|and protect them from the evil consequ [of their deeds]. and he whom you protect from evil consequ that day - you will have given him mercy. and that is the great attainment."
40|10|indeed, those who disbeliev will be addressed, "the hatr of allah for you wa [even] greater than your hatr of yourselv [thi day in hell] when you were invit to faith, but you refused."
40|11|they will say, "our lord, you made us lifeless twice and gave us life twice, and we have confess our sins. So is there to an exit ani way?"
40|12|[they will be told], "that is because, when allah wa call upon alone, you disbelieved; but if other were associ with him, you believed. So the judgement is with allah, the most high, the grand."
40|13|it is He who show you hi sign and send down to you from the sky, provision. but none will rememb except he who turn back [in repentance].
40|14|so invok allah, [being] sincer to him in religion, although the disbeliev dislik it.
40|15|[h is] the exalt abov [all] degrees, owner of the throne; He place the inspir of hi command upon whom He will of hi servant to warn of the day of meeting.
40|16|th day they come forth noth concern them will be conceal from allah. To whom belong [all] sovereignti thi day? To allah, the one, the prevailing.
40|17|thi day everi soul will be recompens for what it earned. No injustic today! indeed, allah is swift in account.
40|18|and warn them, [O muhammad], of the approach day, when heart are at the throats, fill [with distress]. for the wrongdoer there will be no devot friend and no intercessor [who is] obeyed.
40|19|h know that which deceiv the eye and what the breast conceal.
40|20|and allah judg with truth, while those they invok besid him judg not with anything. indeed, allah - He is the hearing, the seeing.
40|21|hav they not travel through the land and observ how wa the end of those who were befor them? they were greater than them in strength and in impress on the land, but allah seiz them for their sins. and they had not from allah ani protector.
40|22|that wa becaus their messeng were come to them with clear proofs, but they disbelieved, so allah seiz them. indeed, He is power and sever in punishment.
40|23|and We did certainli send mose with our sign and a clear authority
40|24|to pharaoh, haman and qarun; but they said, "[he is] a magician and a liar."
40|25|and when he brought them the truth from us, they said, "kill the son of those who have believ with him and keep their women alive." but the plan of the disbeliev is not except in error.
40|26|and pharaoh said, "let me kill mose and let him call upon hi lord. indeed, I fear that he will chang your religion or that he will caus corrupt in the land."
40|27|but mose said, "indeed, I have sought refug in my lord and your lord from everi arrog one who doe not believ in the day of account."
40|28|and a believ man from the famili of pharaoh who conceal hi faith said, "do you kill a man [merely] becaus he says, 'mi lord is allah' while he ha brought you clear proof from your lord? and if he should be lying, then upon him is [the consequ of] hi lie; but if he should be truthful, there will strike you some of what he promis you. indeed, allah doe not guid one who is a transgressor and a liar.
40|29|o my people, sovereignti is your today, [your being] domin in the land. but who would protect us from the punish of allah if it came to us?" pharaoh said, "I do not show you except what I see, and I do not guid you except to the way of right conduct."
40|30|and he who believ said, "O my people, inde I fear for you [a fate] like the day of the compani -
40|31|like the custom of the peopl of noah and of 'aad and thamud and those after them. and allah want no injustic for [his] servants.
40|32|and O my people, inde I fear for you the day of call -
40|33|the day you will turn your back fleeing; there is not for you from allah ani protector. and whoever allah leav astray - there is not for him ani guide.
40|34|and joseph had alreadi come to you befor with clear proofs, but you remain in doubt of that which he brought to you, until when he died, you said, 'never will allah send a messeng after him.' thu doe allah leav astray he who is a transgressor and skeptic."
40|35|thos who disput concern the sign of allah without an author have come to them - great is hatr [of them] in the sight of allah and in the sight of those who have believed. thu doe allah seal over everi heart [belong to] an arrog tyrant.
40|36|and pharaoh said, "O haman, construct for me a tower that I might reach the way -
40|37|the way into the heaven - so that I may look at the deiti of moses; but indeed, I think he is a liar." and thu wa made attract to pharaoh the evil of hi deed, and he wa avert from the [right] way. and the plan of pharaoh wa not except in ruin.
40|38|and he who believ said, "O my people, follow me, I will guid you to the way of right conduct.
40|39|o my people, thi worldli life is onli [temporary] enjoyment, and indeed, the hereaft - that is the home of [permanent] settlement.
40|40|whoev doe an evil deed will not be recompens except by the like thereof; but whoever doe righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believ - those will enter paradise, be given provis therein without account.
40|41|and O my people, how is it that I invit you to salvat while you invit me to the fire?
40|42|y invit me to disbeliev in allah and associ with him that of which I have no knowledge, and I invit you to the exalt in might, the perpetu forgiver.
40|43|assuredly, that to which you invit me ha no [respons to a] supplic in thi world or in the hereafter; and indeed, our return is to allah, and indeed, the transgressor will be companion of the fire.
40|44|and you will rememb what I [now] say to you, and I entrust my affair to allah. indeed, allah is see of [his] servants."
40|45|so allah protect him from the evil they plotted, and the peopl of pharaoh were envelop by the worst of punish -
40|46|the fire, they are expos to it morn and evening. and the day the hour appear [it will be said], "make the peopl of pharaoh enter the severest punishment."
40|47|and [mention] when they will argu within the fire, and the weak will say to those who had been arrogant, "indeed, we were [only] your followers, so will you reliev us of a share of the fire?"
40|48|thos who had been arrog will say, "indeed, all [of us] are in it. indeed, allah ha judg between the servants."
40|49|and those in the fire will say to the keeper of hell, "supplic your lord to lighten for us a day from the punishment."
40|50|they will say, "did there not come to you your messeng with clear proofs?" they will say, "yes." they will reply, "then supplic [yourselves], but the supplic of the disbeliev is not except in error."
40|51|indeed, We will support our messeng and those who believ dure the life of thi world and on the day when the wit will stand -
40|52|the day their excus will not benefit the wrongdoers, and they will have the curse, and they will have the worst home.
40|53|and We had certainli given mose guidance, and We caus the children of israel to inherit the scripture
40|54|a guidanc and a remind for those of understanding.
40|55|so be patient, [O muhammad]. indeed, the promis of allah is truth. and ask forgiv for your sin and exalt [allah] with prais of your lord in the even and the morning.
40|56|indeed, those who disput concern the sign of allah without [any] author have come to them - there is not within their breast except pride, [the extent of] which they cannot reach. So seek refug in allah. indeed, it is He who is the hearing, the seeing.
40|57|th creation of the heaven and earth is greater than the creation of mankind, but most of the peopl do not know.
40|58|and not equal are the blind and the seeing, nor are those who believ and do righteou deed and the evildoer. littl do you remember.
40|59|indeed, the hour is come - no doubt about it - but most of the peopl do not believe.
40|60|and your lord says, "call upon me; I will respond to you." indeed, those who disdain My worship will enter hell [rendered] contemptible.
40|61|it is allah who made for you the night that you may rest therein and the day give sight. indeed, allah is full of bounti to the people, but most of the peopl are not grateful.
40|62|that is allah, your lord, creator of all things; there is no deiti except him, so how are you deluded?
40|63|thu were those [befor you] delud who were reject the sign of allah.
40|64|it is allah who made for you the earth a place of settlement and the sky a ceil and form you and perfect your form and provid you with good things. that is allah, your lord; then bless is allah, lord of the worlds.
40|65|h is the ever-living; there is no deiti except him, so call upon him, [being] sincer to him in religion. [all] prais is [due] to allah, lord of the worlds.
40|66|say, [O muhammad], "indeed, I have been forbidden to worship those you call upon besid allah onc the clear proof have come to me from my lord, and I have been command to submit to the lord of the worlds."
40|67|it is He who creat you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a cling clot; then He bring you out as a child; then [he develop you] that you reach your [time of] maturity, then [further] that you becom elders. and among you is he who is taken in death befor [that], so that you reach a specifi term; and perhap you will use reason.
40|68|h it is who give life and caus death; and when He decre a matter, He but say to it, "be," and it is.
40|69|do you not consid those who disput concern the sign of allah - how are they averted?
40|70|thos who deni the book and that with which We sent our messeng - they are go to know,
40|71|when the shackl are around their neck and the chains; they will be dragged
40|72|in boil water; then in the fire they will be fill [with flame].
40|73|then it will be said to them, "where is that which you use to associ [with him in worship]
40|74|oth than allah?" they will say, "they have depart from us; rather, we did not use to invok previous anything." thu doe allah put astray the disbelievers.
40|75|[th angel will say], "that wa becaus you use to exult upon the earth without right and you use to behav insolently.
40|76|ent the gate of hell to abid etern therein, and wretch is the resid of the arrogant."
40|77|so be patient, [O muhammad]; indeed, the promis of allah is truth. and whether We show you some of what We have promis them or We take you in death, it is to Us they will be returned.
40|78|and We have alreadi sent messeng befor you. among them are those [whose stories] We have relat to you, and among them are those [whose stories] We have not relat to you. and it wa not for ani messeng to bring a sign [or verse] except by permiss of allah. So when the command of allah comes, it will be conclud in truth, and the falsifi will thereupon lose [all].
40|79|it is allah who made for you the graze anim upon which you ride, and some of them you eat.
40|80|and for you therein are [other] benefit and that you may realiz upon them a need which is in your breasts; and upon them and upon ship you are carried.
40|81|and He show you hi signs. So which of the sign of allah do you deny?
40|82|hav they not travel through the land and observ how wa the end of those befor them? they were more numer than themselv and greater in strength and in impress on the land, but they were not avail by what they use to earn.
40|83|and when their messeng came to them with clear proofs, they [merely] rejoic in what they had of knowledge, but they were envelop by what they use to ridicule.
40|84|and when they saw our punishment, they said," We believ in allah alon and disbeliev in that which we use to associ with him."
40|85|but never did their faith benefit them onc they saw our punishment. [it is] the establish way of allah which ha preced among hi servants. and the disbeliev thereupon lost [all].
41|1|ha, meem.
41|2|[thi is] a revel from the entir merciful, the especi merci -
41|3|a book whose vers have been detailed, an arab qur'an for a peopl who know,
41|4|a a giver of good tide and a warner; but most of them turn away, so they do not hear.
41|5|and they say, "our heart are within cover from that to which you invit us, and in our ear is deafness, and between us and you is a partition, so work; indeed, we are working."
41|6|say, O [muhammad], "I am onli a man like you to whom it ha been reveal that your god is but one god; so take a straight cours to him and seek hi forgiveness." and woe to those who associ other with allah -
41|7|those who do not give zakah, and in the hereaft they are disbelievers.
41|8|indeed, those who believ and do righteou deed - for them is a reward uninterrupted.
41|9|say, "do you inde disbeliev in He who creat the earth in two day and attribut to him equals? that is the lord of the worlds."
41|10|and He place on the earth firmli set mountain over it surface, and He bless it and determin therein it [creatures'] susten in four day without distinct - for [the information] of those who ask.
41|11|then He direct himself to the heaven while it wa smoke and said to it and to the earth, "come [into being], willingli or by compulsion." they said, "we have come willingly."
41|12|and He complet them as seven heaven within two day and inspir in each heaven it command. and We adorn the nearest heaven with lamp and as protection. that is the determin of the exalt in might, the knowing.
41|13|but if they turn away, then say, "I have warn you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt [that struck] 'aad and thamud.
41|14|[that occurred] when the messeng had come to them befor them and after them, [saying], "worship not except allah." they said, "if our lord had willed, He would have sent down the angels, so inde we, in that with which you have been sent, are disbelievers."
41|15|a for 'aad, they were arrog upon the earth without right and said, "who is greater than us in strength?" did they not consid that allah who creat them wa greater than them in strength? but they were reject our signs.
41|16|so We sent upon them a scream wind dure day of misfortun to make them tast the punish of disgrac in the worldli life; but the punish of the hereaft is more disgracing, and they will not be helped.
41|17|and as for thamud, We guid them, but they prefer blind over guidance, so the thunderbolt of humili punish seiz them for what they use to earn.
41|18|and We save those who believ and use to fear allah.
41|19|and [mention, O muhammad], the day when the enemi of allah will be gather to the fire while they are [driven] assembl in rows,
41|20|until, when they reach it, their hear and their eye and their skin will testifi against them of what they use to do.
41|21|and they will say to their skins, "whi have you testifi against us?" they will say, "we were made to speak by allah, who ha made everyth speak; and He creat you the first time, and to him you are returned.
41|22|and you were not cover yourselves, lest your hear testifi against you or your sight or your skins, but you assum that allah doe not know much of what you do.
41|23|and that wa your assumpt which you assum about your lord. It ha brought you to ruin, and you have becom among the losers."
41|24|so [even] if they are patient, the fire is a resid for them; and if they ask to appeas [allah], they will not be of those who are allow to appease.
41|25|and We appoint for them companion who made attract to them what wa befor them and what wa behind them [of sin], and the word ha come into effect upon them among nation which had pass on befor them of jinn and men. indeed, they [all] were losers.
41|26|and those who disbeliev say, "do not listen to thi qur'an and speak noisili dure [the recit of] it that perhap you will overcome."
41|27|but We will sure caus those who disbeliev to tast a sever punishment, and We will sure recompens them for the worst of what they had been doing.
41|28|that is the recompens of the enemi of allah - the fire. for them therein is the home of etern as recompens for what they, of our verses, were rejecting.
41|29|and those who disbeliev will [then] say, "our lord, show us those who misl us of the jinn and men [so] we may put them under our feet that they will be among the lowest."
41|30|indeed, those who have said, "our lord is allah " and then remain on a right cours - the angel will descend upon them, [saying], "do not fear and do not griev but receiv good tide of paradise, which you were promised.
41|31|w [angels] were your alli in worldli life and [are so] in the hereafter. and you will have therein whatev your soul desire, and you will have therein whatev you request [or wish]
41|32|a accommod from a [lord who is] forgiv and merciful."
41|33|and who is better in speech than one who invit to allah and doe righteous and says, "indeed, I am of the muslims."
41|34|and not equal are the good deed and the bad. repel [evil] by that [deed] which is better; and thereupon the one whom between you and him is enmiti [will become] as though he wa a devot friend.
41|35|but none is grant it except those who are patient, and none is grant it except one have a great portion [of good].
41|36|and if there come to you from satan an evil suggestion, then seek refug in allah. indeed, He is the hearing, the knowing.
41|37|and of hi sign are the night and day and the sun and moon. Do not prostrat to the sun or to the moon, but prostat to allah, who creat them, if it should be him that you worship.
41|38|but if they are arrog - then those who are near your lord exalt him by night and by day, and they do not becom weary.
41|39|and of hi sign is that you see the earth stilled, but when We send down upon it rain, it quiver and grows. indeed, He who ha given it life is the giver of life to the dead. indeed, He is over all thing competent.
41|40|indeed, those who inject deviat into our vers are not conceal from us. so, is he who is cast into the fire better or he who come secur on the day of resurrection? Do whatev you will; indeed, He is see of what you do.
41|41|indeed, those who disbeliev in the messag after it ha come to them... and indeed, it is a mighti book.
41|42|falsehood cannot approach it from befor it or from behind it; [it is] a revel from a [lord who is] wise and praiseworthy.
41|43|noth is said to you, [O muhammad], except what wa alreadi said to the messeng befor you. indeed, your lord is a possessor of forgiv and a possessor of pain penalty.
41|44|and if We had made it a non-arab qur'an, they would have said, "whi are it vers not explain in detail [in our language]? Is it a foreign [recitation] and an arab [messenger]?" say, "it is, for those who believe, a guidanc and cure." and those who do not believ - in their ear is deafness, and it is upon them blindness. those are be call from a distant place.
41|45|and We had alreadi given mose the scripture, but it came under disagreement. and if not for a word that preced from your lord, it would have been conclud between them. and inde they are, concern the qur'an, in disquiet doubt.
41|46|whoev doe righteous - it is for hi [own] soul; and whoever doe evil [doe so] against it. and your lord is not ever unjust to [his] servants.
41|47|to him [alone] is attribut knowledg of the hour. and fruit emerg not from their cover nor doe a femal conceiv or give birth except with hi knowledge. and the day He will call to them, "where are My 'partners'?" they will say, "we announc to you that there is [no longer] among us ani wit [to that]."
41|48|and lost from them will be those they were invok before, and they will be certain that they have no place of escape.
41|49|man is not weari of supplic for good [things], but if evil touch him, he is hopeless and despairing.
41|50|and if We let him tast merci from Us after an advers which ha touch him, he will sure say, "thi is [due] to me, and I do not think the hour will occur; and [even] if I should be return to my lord, indeed, for me there will be with him the best." but We will sure inform those who disbeliev about what they did, and We will sure make them tast a massiv punishment.
41|51|and when We bestow favor upon man, he turn away and distanc himself; but when evil touch him, then he is full of extens supplication.
41|52|say, "have you considered: if the qur'an is from allah and you disbeliev in it, who would be more astray than one who is in extrem dissension?"
41|53|w will show them our sign in the horizon and within themselv until it becom clear to them that it is the truth. but is it not suffici concern your lord that He is, over all things, a witness?
41|54|unquestionably, they are in doubt about the meet with their lord. unquestion He is, of all things, encompassing.
42|1|ha, meem.
42|2|'ayn, seen, qaf.
42|3|thu ha He reveal to you, [O muhammad], and to those befor you - allah, the exalt in might, the wise.
42|4|to him belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is in the earth, and He is the most high, the most great.
42|5|th heaven almost break from abov them, and the angel exalt [allah] with prais of their lord and ask forgiv for those on earth. unquestionably, it is allah who is the forgiving, the merciful.
42|6|and those who take as alli other than him - allah is [yet] guardian over them; and you, [O muhammad], are not over them a manager.
42|7|and thu We have reveal to you an arab qur'an that you may warn the mother of citi [makkah] and those around it and warn of the day of assembly, about which there is no doubt. A parti will be in paradis and a parti in the blaze.
42|8|and if allah willed, He could have made them [of] one religion, but He admit whom He will into hi mercy. and the wrongdoer have not ani protector or helper.
42|9|or have they taken protector [or allies] besid him? but allah - He is the protector, and He give life to the dead, and He is over all thing competent.
42|10|and in anyth over which you disagre - it rule is [to be referred] to allah. [say], "that is allah, my lord; upon him I have relied, and to him I turn back."
42|11|[h is] creator of the heaven and the earth. He ha made for you from yourselves, mates, and among the cattle, mates; He multipli you thereby. there is noth like unto him, and He is the hearing, the seeing.
42|12|to him belong the key of the heaven and the earth. He extend provis for whom He will and restrict [it]. inde He is, of all things, knowing.
42|13|h ha ordain for you of religion what He enjoin upon noah and that which We have reveal to you, [O muhammad], and what We enjoin upon abraham and mose and jesu - to establish the religion and not be divid therein. difficult for those who associ other with allah is that to which you invit them. allah choos for himself whom He will and guid to himself whoever turn back [to him].
42|14|and they did not becom divid until after knowledg had come to them - out of jealou animos between themselves. and if not for a word that preced from your lord [postpon the penalty] until a specifi time, it would have been conclud between them. and indeed, those who were grant inherit of the scriptur after them are, concern it, in disquiet doubt.
42|15|so to that [religion of allah] invite, [O muhammad], and remain on a right cours as you are command and do not follow their inclin but say, "I have believ in what allah ha reveal of the qur'an, and I have been command to do justic among you. allah is our lord and your lord. for us are our deeds, and for you your deeds. there is no [need for] argument between us and you. allah will bring us together, and to him is the [final] destination."
42|16|and those who argu concern allah after He ha been respond to - their argument is invalid with their lord, and upon them is [his] wrath, and for them is a sever punishment.
42|17|it is allah who ha sent down the book in truth and [also] the balance. and what will make you perceive? perhap the hour is near.
42|18|thos who do not believ in it are impati for it, but those who believ are fear of it and know that it is the truth. unquestionably, those who disput concern the hour are in extrem error.
42|19|allah is subtl with hi servants; He give provis to whom He wills. and He is the powerful, the exalt in might.
42|20|whoev desir the harvest of the hereaft - We increas for him in hi harvest. and whoever desir the harvest of thi world - We give him thereof, but there is not for him in the hereaft ani share.
42|21|or have they other deiti who have ordain for them a religion to which allah ha not consented? but if not for the decis word, it would have been conclud between them. and indeed, the wrongdoer will have a pain punishment.
42|22|y will see the wrongdoer fear of what they have earned, and it will [certainly] befal them. and those who have believ and done righteou deed will be in lush region of the garden [in paradise] have whatev they will in the presenc of their lord. that is what is the great bounty.
42|23|it is that of which allah give good tide to hi servant who believ and do righteou deeds. say, [O muhammad], "I do not ask you for thi messag ani payment [but] onli good will through kinship." and whoever commit a good deed - We will increas for him good therein. indeed, allah is forgiv and appreciative.
42|24|or do they say, "he ha invent about allah a lie"? but if allah willed, He could seal over your heart. and allah elimin falsehood and establish the truth by hi words. indeed, He is know of that within the breasts.
42|25|and it is He who accept repent from hi servant and pardon misdeeds, and He know what you do.
42|26|and He answer [the supplic of] those who have believ and done righteou deed and increas [for] them from hi bounty. but the disbeliev will have a sever punishment.
42|27|and if allah had extend [excessively] provis for hi servants, they would have commit tyranni throughout the earth. but He send [it] down in an amount which He wills. inde He is, of hi servants, acquaint and seeing.
42|28|and it is He who send down the rain after they had despair and spread hi mercy. and He is the protector, the praiseworthy.
42|29|and of hi sign is the creation of the heaven and earth and what He ha dispers throughout them of creatures. and he, for gather them when He wills, is competent.
42|30|and whatev strike you of disast - it is for what your hand have earned; but He pardon much.
42|31|and you will not caus failur [to allah] upon the earth. and you have not besid allah ani protector or helper.
42|32|and of hi sign are the ship in the sea, like mountains.
42|33|if He willed, He could still the wind, and they would remain motionless on it surface. inde in that are sign for everyon patient and grateful.
42|34|or He could destroy them for what they earned; but He pardon much.
42|35|and [that is so] those who disput concern our sign may know that for them there is no place of escape.
42|36|so whatev thing you have been given - it is but [for] enjoy of the worldli life. but what is with allah is better and more last for those who have believ and upon their lord rely
42|37|and those who avoid the major sin and immoralities, and when they are angry, they forgive,
42|38|and those who have respond to their lord and establish prayer and whose affair is [determin by] consult among themselves, and from what We have provid them, they spend.
42|39|and those who, when tyranni strike them, they defend themselves,
42|40|and the retribut for an evil act is an evil one like it, but whoever pardon and make reconcili - hi reward is [due] from allah. indeed, He doe not like wrongdoers.
42|41|and whoever aveng himself after have been wrong - those have not upon them ani caus [for blame].
42|42|th caus is onli against the one who wrong the peopl and tyrann upon the earth without right. those will have a pain punishment.
42|43|and whoever is patient and forgiv - indeed, that is of the matter [requiring] determination.
42|44|and he whom allah send astray - for him there is no protector beyond him. and you will see the wrongdoers, when they see the punishment, saying, "i there for return [to the former world] ani way?"
42|45|and you will see them be expos to the fire, humbl from humiliation, look from [behind] a covert glance. and those who had believ will say, "indeed, the [true] loser are the one who lost themselv and their famili on the day of resurrection. unquestionably, the wrongdoer are in an endur punishment."
42|46|and there will not be for them ani alli to aid them other than allah. and whoever allah send astray - for him there is no way.
42|47|respond to your lord befor a day come from allah of which there is no repelling. No refug will you have that day, nor for you will there be ani denial.
42|48|but if they turn away - then We have not sent you, [O muhammad], over them as a guardian; upon you is onli [the duti of] notification. and indeed, when We let man tast merci from us, he rejoic in it; but if evil afflict him for what hi hand have put forth, then indeed, man is ungrateful.
42|49|to allah belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth; He creat what he wills. He give to whom He will femal [children], and He give to whom He will males.
42|50|or He make them [both] male and females, and He render whom He will barren. indeed, He is know and competent.
42|51|and it is not for ani human be that allah should speak to him except by revel or from behind a partit or that He send a messeng to reveal, by hi permission, what He wills. indeed, He is most high and wise.
42|52|and thu We have reveal to you an inspir of our command. you did not know what is the book or [what is] faith, but We have made it a light by which We guid whom We will of our servants. and indeed, [O muhammad], you guid to a straight path -
42|53|the path of allah, to whom belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth. unquestionably, to allah do [all] matter evolve.
43|1|ha, meem.
43|2|bi the clear book,
43|3|indeed, We have made it an arab qur'an that you might understand.
43|4|and inde it is, in the mother of the book with us, exalt and full of wisdom.
43|5|then should We turn the messag away, disregard you, becaus you are a transgress people?
43|6|and how mani a prophet We sent among the former peoples,
43|7|but there would not come to them a prophet except that they use to ridicul him.
43|8|and We destroy greater than them in [striking] power, and the exampl of the former peopl ha preceded.
43|9|and if you should ask them, "who ha creat the heaven and the earth?" they would sure say, "they were creat by the exalt in might, the knowing."
43|10|[th one] who ha made for you the earth a bed and made for you upon it road that you might be guided
43|11|and who send down rain from the sky in measur amounts, and We reviv therebi a dead land - thu will you be brought forth -
43|12|and who creat the species, all of them, and ha made for you of ship and anim those which you mount.
43|13|that you may settl yourselv upon their back and then rememb the favor of your lord when you have settl upon them and say. "exalt is He who ha subject thi to us, and we could not have [otherwise] subdu it.
43|14|and inde we, to our lord, will [surely] return."
43|15|but they have attribut to him from hi servant a portion. indeed, man is clearli ungrateful.
43|16|or ha He taken, out of what He ha created, daughter and chosen you for [having] sons?
43|17|and when one of them is given good tide of that which he attribut to the most merci in comparison, hi face becom dark, and he suppress grief.
43|18|so is one brought up in ornament while be dure conflict unevid [attribut to allah]?
43|19|and they have made the angels, who are servant of the most merciful, females. did they wit their creation? their testimoni will be recorded, and they will be questioned.
43|20|and they said, "if the most merci had willed, we would not have worship them." they have of that no knowledge. they are not but falsifying.
43|21|or have We given them a book befor the qur'an to which they are adhering?
43|22|rather, they say, "indeed, we found our father upon a religion, and we are in their footstep [rightly] guided."
43|23|and similarly, We did not send befor you ani warner into a citi except that it affluent said, "indeed, we found our father upon a religion, and we are, in their footsteps, following."
43|24|[each warner] said, "even if I brought you better guidanc than that [religion] upon which you found your fathers?" they said, "inde we, in that with which you were sent, are disbelievers."
43|25|so we took retribut from them; then see how wa the end of the deniers.
43|26|and [mention, O muhammad], when abraham said to hi father and hi people, "indeed, I am disassoci from that which you worship
43|27|except for He who creat me; and indeed, He will guid me."
43|28|and he made it a word remain among hi descend that they might return [to it].
43|29|however, I gave enjoy to these [peopl of makkah] and their father until there came to them the truth and a clear messenger.
43|30|but when the truth came to them, they said, "thi is magic, and inde we are, concern it, disbelievers."
43|31|and they said, "whi wa thi qur'an not sent down upon a great man from [one of] the two cities?"
43|32|do they distribut the merci of your lord? It is We who have apport among them their livelihood in the life of thi world and have rais some of them abov other in degre [of rank] that they may make use of one anoth for service. but the merci of your lord is better than whatev they accumulate.
43|33|and if it were not that the peopl would becom one commun [of disbelievers], We would have made for those who disbeliev in the most merci - for their hous - ceil and stairway of silver upon which to mount
43|34|and for their hous - door and couch [of silver] upon which to recline
43|35|and gold ornament. but all that is not but the enjoy of worldli life. and the hereaft with your lord is for the righteous.
43|36|and whoever is blind from remembr of the most merci - We appoint for him a devil, and he is to him a companion.
43|37|and indeed, the devil avert them from the way [of guidance] while they think that they are [rightly] guided
43|38|until, when he come to Us [at judgement], he say [to hi companion], "oh, I wish there wa between me and you the distanc between the east and west - how wretch a companion."
43|39|and never will it benefit you that day, when you have wronged, that you are [all] share in the punishment.
43|40|then will you make the deaf hear, [O muhammad], or guid the blind or he who is in clear error?
43|41|and whether [or not] We take you away [in death], indeed, We will take retribut upon them.
43|42|or whether [or not] We show you that which We have promis them, indeed, We are perfect in ability.
43|43|so adher to that which is reveal to you. indeed, you are on a straight path.
43|44|and indeed, it is a remembr for you and your people, and you [all] are go to be questioned.
43|45|and ask those We sent befor you of our messengers; have We made besid the most merci deiti to be worshipped?
43|46|and certainli did We send mose with our sign to pharaoh and hi establishment, and he said, "indeed, I am the messeng of the lord of the worlds."
43|47|but when he brought them our signs, at onc they laugh at them.
43|48|and We show them not a sign except that it wa greater than it sister, and We seiz them with afflict that perhap they might return [to faith].
43|49|and they said [to moses], "O magician, invok for us your lord by what He ha promis you. indeed, we will be guided."
43|50|but when We remov from them the affliction, at onc they broke their word.
43|51|and pharaoh call out among hi people; he said, "O my people, doe not the kingdom of egypt belong to me, and these river flow beneath me; then do you not see?
43|52|or am I [not] better than thi one who is insignific and hardli make himself clear?
43|53|then whi have there not been place upon him bracelet of gold or come with him the angel in conjunction?"
43|54|so he bluf hi people, and they obey him. indeed, they were [themselves] a peopl defiantli disobedi [of allah].
43|55|and when they anger us, We took retribut from them and drown them all.
43|56|and We made them a preced and an exampl for the later peoples.
43|57|and when the son of mari wa present as an example, immedi your peopl laugh aloud.
43|58|and they said, "are your god better, or is he?" they did not present the comparison except for [mere] argument. but, [in fact], they are a peopl prone to dispute.
43|59|jesu wa not but a servant upon whom We bestow favor, and We made him an exampl for the children of israel.
43|60|and if We willed, We could have made [instead] of you angel succeed [one another] on the earth.
43|61|and indeed, jesu will be [a sign for] knowledg of the hour, so be not in doubt of it, and follow me. thi is a straight path.
43|62|and never let satan avert you. indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.
43|63|and when jesu brought clear proofs, he said, "I have come to you with wisdom and to make clear to you some of that over which you differ, so fear allah and obey me.
43|64|indeed, allah is my lord and your lord, so worship him. thi is a straight path."
43|65|but the denomin from among them differ [and separated], so woe to those who have wrong from the punish of a pain day.
43|66|ar they wait except for the hour to come upon them suddenli while they perceiv not?
43|67|clos friends, that day, will be enemi to each other, except for the righteous
43|68|[to whom allah will say], "O My servants, no fear will there be concern you thi day, nor will you grieve,
43|69|[you] who believ in our vers and were muslims.
43|70|ent paradise, you and your kinds, delighted."
43|71|circul among them will be plate and vessel of gold. and therein is whatev the soul desir and [what] delight the eyes, and you will abid therein eternally.
43|72|and that is paradis which you are made to inherit for what you use to do.
43|73|for you therein is much fruit from which you will eat.
43|74|indeed, the crimin will be in the punish of hell, abid eternally.
43|75|it will not be allow to subsid for them, and they, therein, are in despair.
43|76|and We did not wrong them, but it wa they who were the wrongdoers.
43|77|and they will call, "O malik, let your lord put an end to us!" He will say, "indeed, you will remain."
43|78|w had certainli brought you the truth, but most of you, to the truth, were averse.
43|79|or have they devis [some] affair? but indeed, We are devis [a plan].
43|80|or do they think that We hear not their secret and their privat conversations? yes, [we do], and our messeng are with them recording.
43|81|say, [O muhammad], "if the most merci had a son, then I would be the first of [his] worshippers."
43|82|exalt is the lord of the heaven and the earth, lord of the throne, abov what they describe.
43|83|so leav them to convers vainli and amus themselv until they meet their day which they are promised.
43|84|and it is allah who is [the only] deiti in the heaven, and on the earth [the only] deity. and He is the wise, the knowing.
43|85|and bless is He to whom belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth and whatev is between them and with whom is knowledg of the hour and to whom you will be returned.
43|86|and those they invok besid him do not possess [power of] intercession; but onli those who testifi to the truth [can benefit], and they know.
43|87|and if you ask them who creat them, they would sure say, "allah." So how are they deluded?
43|88|and [allah acknowledges] hi saying, "O my lord, inde these are a peopl who do not believe."
43|89|so turn asid from them and say, "peace." but they are go to know.
44|1|ha, meem.
44|2|bi the clear book,
44|3|indeed, We sent it down dure a bless night. indeed, We were to warn [mankind].
44|4|on that night is made distinct everi precis matter -
44|5|[every] matter [proceeding] from us. indeed, We were to send [a messenger]
44|6|a merci from your lord. indeed, He is the hearing, the knowing.
44|7|lord of the heaven and the earth and that between them, if you would be certain.
44|8|ther is no deiti except him; He give life and caus death. [he is] your lord and the lord of your first forefathers.
44|9|but they are in doubt, amus themselves.
44|10|then watch for the day when the sky will bring a visibl smoke.
44|11|cov the people; thi is a pain torment.
44|12|[they will say], "our lord, remov from us the torment; indeed, we are believers."
44|13|how will there be for them a remind [at that time]? and there had come to them a clear messenger.
44|14|then they turn away from him and said, "[he was] taught [and is] a madman."
44|15|indeed, We will remov the torment for a little. indeed, you [disbelievers] will return [to disbelief].
44|16|th day We will strike with the greatest assault, indeed, We will take retribution.
44|17|and We had alreadi tri befor them the peopl of pharaoh, and there came to them a nobl messenger,
44|18|[saying], "render to me the servant of allah. indeed, I am to you a trustworthi messenger,"
44|19|and [saying], "be not haughti with allah. indeed, I have come to you with clear authority.
44|20|and indeed, I have sought refug in my lord and your lord, lest you stone me.
44|21|but if you do not believ me, then leav me alone."
44|22|and [finally] he call to hi lord that these were a crimin people.
44|23|[allah said], "then set out with My servant by night. indeed, you are to be pursued.
44|24|and leav the sea in stillness. indeed, they are an armi to be drowned."
44|25|how much they left behind of garden and springs
44|26|and crop and nobl sites
44|27|and comfort wherein they were amused.
44|28|thus. and We caus to inherit it anoth people.
44|29|and the heaven and earth wept not for them, nor were they reprieved.
44|30|and We certainli save the children of israel from the humili torment -
44|31|from pharaoh. indeed, he wa a haughti one among the transgressors.
44|32|and We certainli chose them by knowledg over [all] the worlds.
44|33|and We gave them of sign that in which there wa a clear trial.
44|34|indeed, these [disbelievers] are saying,
44|35|"ther is not but our first death, and we will not be resurrected.
44|36|then bring [back] our forefathers, if you should be truthful."
44|37|ar they better or the peopl of tubba' and those befor them? We destroy them, [for] indeed, they were criminals.
44|38|and We did not creat the heaven and earth and that between them in play.
44|39|w did not creat them except in truth, but most of them do not know.
44|40|indeed, the day of judgement is the appoint time for them all -
44|41|the day when no relat will avail a relat at all, nor will they be help -
44|42|except those [believers] on whom allah ha mercy. indeed, He is the exalt in might, the merciful.
44|43|indeed, the tree of zaqqum
44|44|i food for the sinful.
44|45|lik murki oil, it boil within bellies
44|46|lik the boil of scald water.
44|47|[it will be commanded], "seiz him and drag him into the midst of the hellfire,
44|48|then pour over hi head from the torment of scald water."
44|49|[it will be said], "taste! indeed, you are the honored, the noble!
44|50|indeed, thi is what you use to dispute."
44|51|indeed, the righteou will be in a secur place;
44|52|within garden and springs,
44|53|wear [garment of] fine silk and brocade, face each other.
44|54|thus. and We will marri them to fair women with large, [beautiful] eyes.
44|55|they will call therein for everi [kind of] fruit - safe and secure.
44|56|they will not tast death therein except the first death, and He will have protect them from the punish of hellfire
44|57|a bounti from your lord. that is what is the great attainment.
44|58|and indeed, We have eas the qur'an in your tongu that they might be reminded.
44|59|so watch, [O muhammad]; indeed, they are watch [for your end].
45|1|ha, meem.
45|2|th revel of the book is from allah, the exalt in might, the wise.
45|3|indeed, within the heaven and earth are sign for the believers.
45|4|and in the creation of yourselv and what He dispers of move creatur are sign for peopl who are certain [in faith].
45|5|and [in] the altern of night and day and [in] what allah send down from the sky of provis and give life therebi to the earth after it lifeless and [in his] direct of the wind are sign for a peopl who reason.
45|6|thes are the vers of allah which We recit to you in truth. then in what statement after allah and hi vers will they believe?
45|7|wo to everi sin liar
45|8|who hear the vers of allah recit to him, then persist arrogantli as if he had not heard them. So give him tide of a pain punishment.
45|9|and when he know anyth of our verses, he take them in ridicule. those will have a humili punishment.
45|10|befor them is hell, and what they had earn will not avail them at all nor what they had taken besid allah as allies. and they will have a great punishment.
45|11|thi [qur'an] is guidance. and those who have disbeliev in the vers of their lord will have a pain punish of foul nature.
45|12|it is allah who subject to you the sea so that ship may sail upon it by hi command and that you may seek of hi bounty; and perhap you will be grateful.
45|13|and He ha subject to you whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth - all from him. inde in that are sign for a peopl who give thought.
45|14|say, [O muhammad], to those who have believ that they [should] forgiv those who expect not the day of allah so that He may recompens a peopl for what they use to earn.
45|15|whoev doe a good deed - it is for himself; and whoever doe evil - it is against the self. then to your lord you will be returned.
45|16|and We did certainli give the children of israel the scriptur and judgement and prophethood, and We provid them with good thing and prefer them over the worlds.
45|17|and We gave them clear proof of the matter [of religion]. and they did not differ except after knowledg had come to them - out of jealou animos between themselves. indeed, your lord will judg between them on the day of resurrect concern that over which they use to differ.
45|18|then We put you, [O muhammad], on an ordain way concern the matter [of religion]; so follow it and do not follow the inclin of those who do not know.
45|19|indeed, they will never avail you against allah at all. and indeed, the wrongdoer are alli of one another; but allah is the protector of the righteous.
45|20|thi [qur'an] is enlighten for mankind and guidanc and merci for a peopl who are certain [in faith].
45|21|or do those who commit evil think We will make them like those who have believ and done righteou deed - [make them] equal in their life and their death? evil is that which they judge.
45|22|and allah creat the heaven and earth in truth and so that everi soul may be recompens for what it ha earned, and they will not be wronged.
45|23|hav you seen he who ha taken as hi god hi [own] desire, and allah ha sent him astray due to knowledg and ha set a seal upon hi hear and hi heart and put over hi vision a veil? So who will guid him after allah? then will you not be reminded?
45|24|and they say, "there is not but our worldli life; we die and live, and noth destroy us except time." and they have of that no knowledge; they are onli assuming.
45|25|and when our vers are recit to them as clear evidences, their argument is onli that they say, "bring [back] our forefathers, if you should be truthful."
45|26|say, "allah caus you to live, then caus you to die; then He will assembl you for the day of resurrection, about which there is no doubt, but most of the peopl do not know."
45|27|and to allah belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth. and the day the hour appear - that day the falsifi will lose.
45|28|and you will see everi nation kneel [from fear]. everi nation will be call to it record [and told], "today you will be recompens for what you use to do.
45|29|this, our record, speak about you in truth. indeed, We were have transcrib whatev you use to do."
45|30|so as for those who believ and did righteou deeds, their lord will admit them into hi mercy. that is what is the clear attainment.
45|31|but as for those who disbelieved, [it will be said], "were not our vers recit to you, but you were arrog and becam a peopl of criminals?
45|32|and when it wa said, 'indeed, the promis of allah is truth and the hour [i coming] - no doubt about it,' you said, 'we know not what is the hour. We assum onli assumption, and we are not convinced.' "
45|33|and the evil consequ of what they did will appear to them, and they will be envelop by what they use to ridicule.
45|34|and it will be said, "today We will forget you as you forgot the meet of thi day of yours, and your refug is the fire, and for you there are no helpers.
45|35|that is becaus you took the vers of allah in ridicule, and worldli life delud you." So that day they will not be remov from it, nor will they be ask to appeas [allah].
45|36|then, to allah belong [all] prais - lord of the heaven and lord of the earth, lord of the worlds.
45|37|and to him belong [all] grandeur within the heaven and the earth, and He is the exalt in might, the wise.
46|1|ha, meem.
46|2|th revel of the book is from allah, the exalt in might, the wise.
46|3|w did not creat the heaven and earth and what is between them except in truth and [for] a specifi term. but those who disbelieve, from that of which they are warned, are turn away.
46|4|say, [O muhammad], "have you consid that which you invok besid allah? show me what they have creat of the earth; or did they have partnership in [creation of] the heavens? bring me a scriptur [revealed] befor thi or a [remaining] trace of knowledge, if you should be truthful."
46|5|and who is more astray than he who invok besid allah those who will not respond to him until the day of resurrection, and they, of their invocation, are unaware.
46|6|and when the peopl are gather [that day], they [who were invoked] will be enemi to them, and they will be denier of their worship.
46|7|and when our vers are recit to them as clear evidences, those who disbeliev say of the truth when it ha come to them, "thi is obviou magic."
46|8|or do they say, "he ha invent it?" say, "if I have invent it, you will not possess for me [the power of protection] from allah at all. He is most know of that in which you are involved. suffici is He as wit between me and you, and He is the forgiv the merciful."
46|9|say, "I am not someth origin among the messengers, nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I onli follow that which is reveal to me, and I am not but a clear warner."
46|10|say, "have you considered: if the qur'an wa from allah, and you disbeliev in it while a wit from the children of israel ha testifi to someth similar and believ while you were arrogant...?" indeed, allah doe not guid the wrongdo people.
46|11|and those who disbeliev say of those who believe, "if it had [truly] been good, they would not have preced us to it." and when they are not guid by it, they will say, "thi is an ancient falsehood."
46|12|and befor it wa the scriptur of mose to lead and as a mercy. and thi is a confirm book in an arab tongu to warn those who have wrong and as good tide to the doer of good.
46|13|indeed, those who have said, "our lord is allah," and then remain on a right cours - there will be no fear concern them, nor will they grieve.
46|14|thos are the companion of paradise, abid etern therein as reward for what they use to do.
46|15|and We have enjoin upon man, to hi parents, good treatment. hi mother carri him with hardship and gave birth to him with hardship, and hi gestat and wean [period] is thirti months. [he grows] until, when he reach matur and reach [the age of] forti years, he says, "mi lord, enabl me to be grate for your favor which you have bestow upon me and upon my parent and to work righteous of which you will approv and make righteou for me my offspring. indeed, I have repent to you, and indeed, I am of the muslims."
46|16|thos are the one from whom We will accept the best of what they did and overlook their misdeeds, [their being] among the companion of paradise. [that is] the promis of truth which they had been promised.
46|17|but one who say to hi parents, "uff to you; do you promis me that I will be brought forth [from the earth] when gener befor me have alreadi pass on [into oblivion]?" while they call to allah for help [and to their son], "woe to you! believe! indeed, the promis of allah is truth." but he says, "thi is not but legend of the former people" -
46|18|those are the one upon whom the word ha come into effect, [who will be] among nation which had pass on befor them of jinn and men. indeed, they [all] were losers.
46|19|and for all there are degre [of reward and punishment] for what they have done, and [it is] so that He may fulli compens them for their deeds, and they will not be wronged.
46|20|and the day those who disbeliev are expos to the fire [it will be said], "you exhaust your pleasur dure your worldli life and enjoy them, so thi day you will be award the punish of [extreme] humili becaus you were arrog upon the earth without right and becaus you were defiantli disobedient."
46|21|and mention, [O muhammad], the brother of 'aad, when he warn hi peopl in the [region of] al-ahqaf - and warner had alreadi pass on befor him and after him - [saying], "do not worship except allah. indeed, I fear for you the punish of a terribl day."
46|22|they said, "have you come to delud us away from our gods? then bring us what you promis us, if you should be of the truthful."
46|23|h said, "knowledg [of it time] is onli with allah, and I convey to you that with which I wa sent; but I see you [to be] a peopl behav ignorantly."
46|24|and when they saw it as a cloud approach their valleys, they said, "thi is a cloud bring us rain!" rather, it is that for which you were impatient: a wind, within it a pain punishment,
46|25|destroy everyth by command of it lord. and they becam so that noth wa seen [of them] except their dwellings. thu do We recompens the crimin people.
46|26|and We had certainli establish them in such as We have not establish you, and We made for them hear and vision and hearts. but their hear and vision and heart avail them not from anyth [of the punishment] when they were [continually] reject the sign of allah; and they were envelop by what they use to ridicule.
46|27|and We have alreadi destroy what surround you of [those] cities, and We have diversifi the sign [or verses] that perhap they might return [from disbelief].
46|28|then whi did those they took besid allah as deiti by which to approach [him] not aid them? but they had stray from them. and that wa their falsehood and what they were inventing.
46|29|and [mention, O muhammad], when We direct to you a few of the jinn, listen to the qur'an. and when they attend it, they said, "listen quietly." and when it wa concluded, they went back to their peopl as warners.
46|30|they said, "O our people, inde we have heard a [recited] book reveal after mose confirm what wa befor it which guid to the truth and to a straight path.
46|31|o our people, respond to the messeng of allah and believ in him; allah will forgiv for you your sin and protect you from a pain punishment.
46|32|but he who doe not respond to the caller of allah will not caus failur [to him] upon earth, and he will not have besid him ani protectors. those are in manifest error."
46|33|do they not see that allah, who creat the heaven and earth and did not fail in their creation, is abl to give life to the dead? yes. indeed, He is over all thing competent.
46|34|and the day those who disbeliev are expos to the fire [it will be said], "i thi not the truth?" they will say, "yes, by our lord." He will say, "then tast the punish becaus you use to disbelieve."
46|35|so be patient, [O muhammad], as were those of determin among the messeng and do not be impati for them. It will be - on the day they see that which they are promis - as though they had not remain [in the world] except an hour of a day. [thi is] notification. and will [any] be destroy except the defiantli disobedi people?
47|1|thos who disbeliev and avert [people] from the way of allah - He will wast their deeds.
47|2|and those who believ and do righteou deed and believ in what ha been sent down upon muhammad - and it is the truth from their lord - He will remov from them their misde and amend their condition.
47|3|that is becaus those who disbeliev follow falsehood, and those who believ follow the truth from their lord. thu doe allah present to the peopl their comparisons.
47|4|so when you meet those who disbeliev [in battle], strike [their] neck until, when you have inflict slaughter upon them, then secur their bonds, and either [confer] favor afterward or ransom [them] until the war lay down it burdens. that [i the command]. and if allah had willed, He could have taken vengeanc upon them [himself], but [he order arm struggle] to test some of you by mean of others. and those who are kill in the caus of allah - never will He wast their deeds.
47|5|h will guid them and amend their condition
47|6|and admit them to paradise, which He ha made known to them.
47|7|o you who have believed, if you support allah, He will support you and plant firmli your feet.
47|8|but those who disbeliev - for them is misery, and He will wast their deeds.
47|9|that is becaus they dislik what allah revealed, so He render worthless their deeds.
47|10|hav they not travel through the land and seen how wa the end of those befor them? allah destroy [everything] over them, and for the disbeliev is someth comparable.
47|11|that is becaus allah is the protector of those who have believ and becaus the disbeliev have no protector.
47|12|indeed, allah will admit those who have believ and done righteou deed to garden beneath which river flow, but those who disbeliev enjoy themselv and eat as graze livestock eat, and the fire will be a resid for them.
47|13|and how mani a citi wa stronger than your citi [makkah] which drove you out? We destroy them; and there wa no helper for them.
47|14|so is he who is on clear evid from hi lord like him to whom the evil of hi work ha been made attract and they follow their [own] desires?
47|15|i the descript of paradise, which the righteou are promised, wherein are river of water unaltered, river of milk the tast of which never changes, river of wine delici to those who drink, and river of purifi honey, in which they will have from all [kind of] fruit and forgiv from their lord, like [that of] those who abid etern in the fire and are given to drink scald water that will sever their intestines?
47|16|and among them, [O muhammad], are those who listen to you, until when they depart from you, they say to those who were given knowledge, "what ha he said just now?" those are the one of whom allah ha seal over their heart and who have follow their [own] desires.
47|17|and those who are guid - He increas them in guidanc and give them their righteousness.
47|18|then do they await except that the hour should come upon them unexpectedly? but alreadi there have come [some of] it indications. then what good to them, when it ha come, will be their remembrance?
47|19|so know, [O muhammad], that there is no deiti except allah and ask forgiv for your sin and for the believ men and believ women. and allah know of your movement and your rest place.
47|20|thos who believ say, "whi ha a surah not been sent down? but when a precis surah is reveal and fight is mention therein, you see those in whose heart is hypocrisi look at you with a look of one overcom by death. and more appropri for them [would have been]
47|21|obedi and good words. and when the matter [of fighting] wa determined, if they had been true to allah, it would have been better for them.
47|22|so would you perhaps, if you turn away, caus corrupt on earth and sever your [ti of] relationship?
47|23|thos [who do so] are the one that allah ha cursed, so He deafen them and blind their vision.
47|24|then do they not reflect upon the qur'an, or are there lock upon [their] hearts?
47|25|indeed, those who revert back [to disbelief] after guidanc had becom clear to them - satan entic them and prolong hope for them.
47|26|that is becaus they said to those who dislik what allah sent down, "we will obey you in part of the matter." and allah know what they conceal.
47|27|then how [will it be] when the angel take them in death, strike their face and their backs?
47|28|that is becaus they follow what anger allah and dislik [what earns] hi pleasure, so He render worthless their deeds.
47|29|or do those in whose heart is diseas think that allah would never expos their [feel of] hatred?
47|30|and if We willed, We could show them to you, and you would know them by their mark; but you will sure know them by the tone of [their] speech. and allah know your deeds.
47|31|and We will sure test you until We make evid those who strive among you [for the caus of allah] and the patient, and We will test your affairs.
47|32|indeed, those who disbeliev and avert [people] from the path of allah and oppos the messeng after guidanc had becom clear to them - never will they harm allah at all, and He will render worthless their deeds.
47|33|o you who have believed, obey allah and obey the messeng and do not invalid your deeds.
47|34|indeed, those who disbeliev and avert [people] from the path of allah and then die while they were disbeliev - never will allah forgiv them.
47|35|so do not weaken and call for peac while you are superior; and allah is with you and will never depriv you of [the reward of] your deeds.
47|36|[this] worldli life is onli amus and diversion. and if you believ and fear allah, He will give you your reward and not ask you for your properties.
47|37|if He should ask you for them and press you, you would withhold, and He would expos your unwillingness.
47|38|her you are - those invit to spend in the caus of allah - but among you are those who withhold [out of greed]. and whoever withhold onli withhold [benefit] from himself; and allah is the free of need, while you are the needy. and if you turn away, He will replac you with anoth people; then they will not be the like of you.
48|1|indeed, We have given you, [O muhammad], a clear conquest
48|2|that allah may forgiv for you what preced of your sin and what will follow and complet hi favor upon you and guid you to a straight path
48|3|and [that] allah may aid you with a mighti victory.
48|4|it is He who sent down tranquil into the heart of the believ that they would increas in faith along with their [present] faith. and to allah belong the soldier of the heaven and the earth, and ever is allah know and wise.
48|5|[and] that He may admit the believ men and the believ women to garden beneath which river flow to abid therein etern and remov from them their misde - and ever is that, in the sight of allah, a great attain -
48|6|and [that] He may punish the hypocrit men and hypocrit women, and the polytheist men and polytheist women - those who assum about allah an assumpt of evil nature. upon them is a misfortun of evil nature; and allah ha becom angri with them and ha curs them and prepar for them hell, and evil it is as a destination.
48|7|and to allah belong the soldier of the heaven and the earth. and ever is allah exalt in might and wise.
48|8|indeed, We have sent you as a wit and a bringer of good tide and a warner
48|9|that you [people] may believ in allah and hi messeng and honor him and respect the prophet and exalt allah morn and afternoon.
48|10|indeed, those who pledg allegi to you, [O muhammad] - they are actual pledg allegi to allah. the hand of allah is over their hands. So he who break hi word onli break it to the detriment of himself. and he who fulfil that which he ha promis allah - He will give him a great reward.
48|11|thos who remain behind of the bedouin will say to you, "our properti and our famili occupi us, so ask forgiv for us." they say with their tongu what is not within their hearts. say, "then who could prevent allah at all if He intend for you harm or intend for you benefit? rather, ever is allah, with what you do, acquainted.
48|12|but you thought that the messeng and the believ would never return to their families, ever, and that wa made pleas in your hearts. and you assum an assumpt of evil and becam a peopl ruined."
48|13|and whoever ha not believ in allah and hi messeng - then indeed, We have prepar for the disbeliev a blaze.
48|14|and to allah belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth. He forgiv whom He will and punish whom He wills. and ever is allah forgiv and merciful.
48|15|thos who remain behind will say when you set out toward the war booti to take it, "let us follow you." they wish to chang the word of allah. say, "never will you follow us. thu did allah say before." So they will say, "rather, you envi us." but [in fact] they were not understand except a little.
48|16|say to those who remain behind of the bedouins, "you will be call to [face] a peopl of great militari might; you may fight them, or they will submit. So if you obey, allah will give you a good reward; but if you turn away as you turn away before, He will punish you with a pain punishment."
48|17|ther is not upon the blind ani guilt or upon the lame ani guilt or upon the ill ani guilt [for remain behind]. and whoever obey allah and hi messeng - He will admit him to garden beneath which river flow; but whoever turn away - He will punish him with a pain punishment.
48|18|certainli wa allah pleas with the believ when they pledg allegi to you, [O muhammad], under the tree, and He knew what wa in their hearts, so He sent down tranquil upon them and reward them with an immin conquest
48|19|and much war booti which they will take. and ever is allah exalt in might and wise.
48|20|allah ha promis you much booti that you will take [in the future] and ha hasten for you thi [victory] and withheld the hand of peopl from you - that it may be a sign for the believ and [that] He may guid you to a straight path.
48|21|and [he promises] other [victories] that you were [so far] unabl to [realize] which allah ha alreadi encompassed. and ever is allah, over all things, competent.
48|22|and if those [makkans] who disbeliev had fought you, they would have turn their back [in flight]. then they would not find a protector or a helper.
48|23|[thi is] the establish way of allah which ha occur before. and never will you find in the way of allah ani change.
48|24|and it is He who withheld their hand from you and your hand from them within [the area of] makkah after He caus you to overcom them. and ever is allah of what you do, seeing.
48|25|they are the one who disbeliev and obstruct you from al-masjid al-haram while the offer wa prevent from reach it place of sacrifice. and if not for believ men and believ women whom you did not know - that you might trampl them and there would befal you becaus of them dishonor without [your] knowledg - [you would have been permit to enter makkah]. [thi wa so] that allah might admit to hi merci whom He willed. If they had been apart [from them], We would have punish those who disbeliev among them with pain punishment
48|26|when those who disbeliev had put into their heart chauvin - the chauvin of the time of ignorance. but allah sent down hi tranquil upon hi messeng and upon the believ and impos upon them the word of righteousness, and they were more deserv of it and worthi of it. and ever is allah, of all things, knowing.
48|27|certainli ha allah show to hi messeng the vision in truth. you will sure enter al-masjid al-haram, if allah wills, in safety, with your head shave and [hair] shortened, not fear [anyone]. He knew what you did not know and ha arrang befor that a conquest near [at hand].
48|28|it is He who sent hi messeng with guidanc and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion. and suffici is allah as witness.
48|29|muhammad is the messeng of allah; and those with him are forc against the disbelievers, merci among themselves. you see them bow and prostrat [in prayer], seek bounti from allah and [his] pleasure. their mark is on their face from the trace of prostration. that is their descript in the torah. and their descript in the gospel is as a plant which produc it offshoot and strengthen them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delight the sower - so that allah may enrag by them the disbelievers. allah ha promis those who believ and do righteou deed among them forgiv and a great reward.
49|1|o you who have believed, do not put [yourselves] befor allah and hi messeng but fear allah. indeed, allah is hear and knowing.
49|2|o you who have believed, do not rais your voic abov the voic of the prophet or be loud to him in speech like the loud of some of you to others, lest your deed becom worthless while you perceiv not.
49|3|indeed, those who lower their voic befor the messeng of allah - they are the one whose heart allah ha test for righteousness. for them is forgiv and great reward.
49|4|indeed, those who call you, [O muhammad], from behind the chamber - most of them do not use reason.
49|5|and if they had been patient until you [could] come out to them, it would have been better for them. but allah is forgiv and merciful.
49|6|o you who have believed, if there come to you a disobedi one with information, investigate, lest you harm a peopl out of ignor and become, over what you have done, regretful.
49|7|and know that among you is the messeng of allah. If he were to obey you in much of the matter, you would be in difficulty, but allah ha endear to you the faith and ha made it pleas in your heart and ha made hate to you disbelief, defianc and disobedience. those are the [rightly] guided.
49|8|[it is] as bounti from allah and favor. and allah is know and wise.
49|9|and if two faction among the believ should fight, then make settlement between the two. but if one of them oppress the other, then fight against the one that oppress until it return to the ordin of allah. and if it returns, then make settlement between them in justic and act justly. indeed, allah love those who act justly.
49|10|th believ are but brothers, so make settlement between your brothers. and fear allah that you may receiv mercy.
49|11|o you who have believed, let not a peopl ridicul [another] people; perhap they may be better than them; nor let women ridicul [other] women; perhap they may be better than them. and do not insult one anoth and do not call each other by [offensive] nicknames. wretch is the name of disobedi after [one's] faith. and whoever doe not repent - then it is those who are the wrongdoers.
49|12|o you who have believed, avoid much [negative] assumption. indeed, some assumpt is sin. and do not spi or backbit each other. would one of you like to eat the flesh of hi brother when dead? you would detest it. and fear allah; indeed, allah is accept of repent and merciful.
49|13|o mankind, inde We have creat you from male and femal and made you peopl and tribe that you may know one another. indeed, the most nobl of you in the sight of allah is the most righteou of you. indeed, allah is know and acquainted.
49|14|th bedouin say, "we have believed." say, "you have not [yet] believed; but say [instead], 'we have submitted,' for faith ha not yet enter your hearts. and if you obey allah and hi messenger, He will not depriv you from your deed of anything. indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful."
49|15|th believ are onli the one who have believ in allah and hi messeng and then doubt not but strive with their properti and their live in the caus of allah. It is those who are the truthful.
49|16|say, "would you acquaint allah with your religion while allah know whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth, and allah is know of all things?"
49|17|they consid it a favor to you that they have accept islam. say, "do not consid your islam a favor to me. rather, allah ha confer favor upon you that He ha guid you to the faith, if you should be truthful."
49|18|indeed, allah know the unseen [aspects] of the heaven and the earth. and allah is see of what you do.
50|1|qaf. By the honor qur'an...
50|2|but they wonder that there ha come to them a warner from among themselves, and the disbeliev say, "thi is an amaz thing.
50|3|when we have die and have becom dust, [we will return to life]? that is a distant return."
50|4|w know what the earth diminish of them, and with Us is a retain record.
50|5|but they deni the truth when it came to them, so they are in a confus condition.
50|6|hav they not look at the heaven abov them - how We structur it and adorn it and [how] it ha no rifts?
50|7|and the earth - We spread it out and cast therein firmli set mountain and made grow therein [something] of everi beauti kind,
50|8|giv insight and a remind for everi servant who turn [to allah].
50|9|and We have sent down bless rain from the sky and made grow therebi garden and grain from the harvest
50|10|and lofti palm tree have fruit arrang in layer -
50|11|a provis for the servants, and We have given life therebi to a dead land. thu is the resurrection.
50|12|th peopl of noah deni befor them, and the companion of the well and thamud
50|13|and 'aad and pharaoh and the brother of lot
50|14|and the companion of the thicket and the peopl of tubba'. all deni the messengers, so My threat wa justli fulfilled.
50|15|did We fail in the first creation? but they are in confus over a new creation.
50|16|and We have alreadi creat man and know what hi soul whisper to him, and We are closer to him than [his] jugular vein
50|17|when the two receiv receive, seat on the right and on the left.
50|18|man doe not utter ani word except that with him is an observ prepar [to record].
50|19|and the intox of death will bring the truth; that is what you were tri to avoid.
50|20|and the horn will be blown. that is the day of [carri out] the threat.
50|21|and everi soul will come, with it a driver and a witness.
50|22|[it will be said], "you were certainli in unmind of this, and We have remov from you your cover, so your sight, thi day, is sharp."
50|23|and hi companion, [the angel], will say, "thi [record] is what is with me, prepared."
50|24|[allah will say], "throw into hell everi obstin disbeliever,
50|25|prevent of good, aggressor, and doubter,
50|26|who made [a equal] with allah anoth deity; then throw him into the sever punishment."
50|27|hi [devil] companion will say, "our lord, I did not make him transgress, but he [himself] wa in extrem error."
50|28|[allah] will say, "do not disput befor me, while I had alreadi present to you the warning.
50|29|th word will not be chang with me, and never will I be unjust to the servants."
50|30|on the day We will say to hell, "have you been filled?" and it will say, "are there some more,"
50|31|and paradis will be brought near to the righteous, not far,
50|32|[it will be said], "thi is what you were promis - for everi return [to allah] and keeper [of hi covenant]
50|33|who fear the most merci unseen and came with a heart return [in repentance].
50|34|ent it in peace. thi is the day of eternity."
50|35|they will have whatev they wish therein, and with Us is more.
50|36|and how mani a gener befor them did We destroy who were greater than them in [striking] power and had explor throughout the lands. Is there ani place of escape?
50|37|inde in that is a remind for whoever ha a heart or who listen while he is present [in mind].
50|38|and We did certainli creat the heaven and earth and what is between them in six days, and there touch Us no weariness.
50|39|so be patient, [O muhammad], over what they say and exalt [allah] with prais of your lord befor the rise of the sun and befor it setting,
50|40|and [in part] of the night exalt him and after prostration.
50|41|and listen on the day when the caller will call out from a place that is near -
50|42|the day they will hear the blast [of the horn] in truth. that is the day of emerg [from the graves].
50|43|indeed, it is We who give life and caus death, and to Us is the destination
50|44|on the day the earth break away from them [and they emerge] rapidly; that is a gather easi for us.
50|45|w are most know of what they say, and you are not over them a tyrant. but remind by the qur'an whoever fear My threat.
51|1|bi those [winds] scatter [dust] dispersing
51|2|and those [clouds] carri a load [of water]
51|3|and those [ships] sail with ease
51|4|and those [angels] apport [each] matter,
51|5|indeed, what you are promis is true.
51|6|and indeed, the recompens is to occur.
51|7|bi the heaven contain pathways,
51|8|indeed, you are in differ speech.
51|9|delud away from the qur'an is he who is deluded.
51|10|destroy are the falsifiers
51|11|who are within a flood [of confusion] and heedless.
51|12|they ask, "when is the day of recompense?"
51|13|[it is] the day they will be torment over the fire
51|14|[and will be told], "tast your torment. thi is that for which you were impatient."
51|15|indeed, the righteou will be among garden and springs,
51|16|accept what their lord ha given them. indeed, they were befor that doer of good.
51|17|they use to sleep but littl of the night,
51|18|and in the hour befor dawn they would ask forgiveness,
51|19|and from their properti wa [given] the right of the [needy] petition and the deprived.
51|20|and on the earth are sign for the certain [in faith]
51|21|and in yourselves. then will you not see?
51|22|and in the heaven is your provis and whatev you are promised.
51|23|then by the lord of the heaven and earth, indeed, it is truth - just as [sure as] it is that you are speaking.
51|24|ha there reach you the stori of the honor guest of abraham? -
51|25|when they enter upon him and said, "[we greet you with] peace." He answered, "[and upon you] peace, [you are] a peopl unknown.
51|26|then he went to hi famili and came with a fat [roasted] calf
51|27|and place it near them; he said, "will you not eat?"
51|28|and he felt from them apprehension. they said, "fear not," and gave him good tide of a learn boy.
51|29|and hi wife approach with a cri [of alarm] and struck her face and said, "[i am] a barren old woman!"
51|30|they said, "thu ha said your lord; indeed, He is the wise, the knowing."
51|31|[abraham] said, "then what is your busi [here], O messengers?"
51|32|they said, "indeed, we have been sent to a peopl of criminals
51|33|to send down upon them stone of clay,
51|34|mark in the presenc of your lord for the transgressors."
51|35|so We brought out whoever wa in the citi of the believers.
51|36|and We found not within them other than a [single] hous of muslims.
51|37|and We left therein a sign for those who fear the pain punishment.
51|38|and in mose [wa a sign], when We sent him to pharaoh with clear authority.
51|39|but he turn away with hi support and said," A magician or a madman."
51|40|so We took him and hi soldier and cast them into the sea, and he wa blameworthy.
51|41|and in 'aad [wa a sign], when We sent against them the barren wind.
51|42|it left noth of what it came upon but that it made it like disintegr ruins.
51|43|and in thamud, when it wa said to them, "enjoy yourselv for a time."
51|44|but they were insol toward the command of their lord, so the thunderbolt seiz them while they were look on.
51|45|and they were unabl to arise, nor could they defend themselves.
51|46|and [we destroyed] the peopl of noah before; indeed, they were a peopl defiantli disobedient.
51|47|and the heaven We construct with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander.
51|48|and the earth We have spread out, and excel is the preparer.
51|49|and of all thing We creat two mates; perhap you will remember.
51|50|so flee to allah. indeed, I am to you from him a clear warner.
51|51|and do not make [a equal] with allah anoth deity. indeed, I am to you from him a clear warner.
51|52|similarly, there came not to those befor them ani messeng except that they said, "A magician or a madman."
51|53|did they suggest it to them? rather, they [themselves] are a transgress people.
51|54|so leav them, [O muhammad], for you are not to be blamed.
51|55|and remind, for indeed, the remind benefit the believers.
51|56|and I did not creat the jinn and mankind except to worship me.
51|57|i do not want from them ani provision, nor do I want them to feed me.
51|58|indeed, it is allah who is the [continual] provider, the firm possessor of strength.
51|59|and indeed, for those who have wrong is a portion [of punishment] like the portion of their predecessors, so let them not impati urg me.
51|60|and woe to those who have disbeliev from their day which they are promised.
52|1|bi the mount
52|2|and [by] a book inscribed
52|3|in parchment spread open
52|4|and [by] the frequent house
52|5|and [by] the heaven rais high
52|6|and [by] the sea fill [with fire],
52|7|indeed, the punish of your lord will occur.
52|8|of it there is no preventer.
52|9|on the day the heaven will sway with circular motion
52|10|and the mountain will pass on, depart -
52|11|then woe, that day, to the deniers,
52|12|who are in [empty] discours amus themselves.
52|13|th day they are thrust toward the fire of hell with a [violent] thrust, [it angel will say],
52|14|"thi is the fire which you use to deny.
52|15|then is thi magic, or do you not see?
52|16|[ent to] burn therein; then be patient or impati - it is all the same for you. you are onli be recompens [for] what you use to do."
52|17|indeed, the righteou will be in garden and pleasure,
52|18|enjoy what their lord ha given them, and their lord protect them from the punish of hellfire.
52|19|[they will be told], "eat and drink in satisfact for what you use to do."
52|20|they will be reclin on throne line up, and We will marri them to fair women with large, [beautiful] eyes.
52|21|and those who believ and whose descend follow them in faith - We will join with them their descendants, and We will not depriv them of anyth of their deeds. everi person, for what he earned, is retained.
52|22|and We will provid them with fruit and meat from whatev they desire.
52|23|they will exchang with one anoth a cup [of wine] wherein [results] no ill speech or commiss of sin.
52|24|ther will circul among them [servant] boy [especially] for them, as if they were pearl well-protected.
52|25|and they will approach one another, inquir of each other.
52|26|they will say, "indeed, we were previous among our peopl fear [of displeas allah].
52|27|so allah confer favor upon us and protect us from the punish of the scorch fire.
52|28|indeed, we use to supplic him before. indeed, it is He who is the beneficent, the merciful."
52|29|so remind [O muhammad], for you are not, by the favor of your lord, a soothsay or a madman.
52|30|or do they say [of you], "A poet for whom we await a misfortun of time?"
52|31|say, "wait, for inde I am, with you, among the waiters."
52|32|or do their mind command them to [say] this, or are they a transgress people?
52|33|or do they say, "he ha made it up"? rather, they do not believe.
52|34|then let them produc a statement like it, if they should be truthful.
52|35|or were they creat by nothing, or were they the creator [of themselves]?
52|36|or did they creat the heaven and the earth? rather, they are not certain.
52|37|or have they the depositori [contain the provision] of your lord? Or are they the control [of them]?
52|38|or have they a stairway [into the heaven] upon which they listen? then let their listen produc a clear authority.
52|39|or ha He daughter while you have sons?
52|40|or do you, [O muhammad], ask of them a payment, so they are by debt burden down?
52|41|or have they [knowledg of] the unseen, so they write [it] down?
52|42|or do they intend a plan? but those who disbeliev - they are the object of a plan.
52|43|or have they a deiti other than allah? exalt is allah abov whatev they associ with him.
52|44|and if they were to see a fragment from the sky falling, they would say, "[it is merely] cloud heap up."
52|45|so leav them until they meet their day in which they will be struck insens -
52|46|the day their plan will not avail them at all, nor will they be helped.
52|47|and indeed, for those who have wrong is a punish befor that, but most of them do not know.
52|48|and be patient, [O muhammad], for the decis of your lord, for indeed, you are in our eyes. and exalt [allah] with prais of your lord when you arise.
52|49|and in a part of the night exalt him and after [the set of] the stars.
53|1|bi the star when it descends,
53|2|your companion [muhammad] ha not strayed, nor ha he erred,
53|3|nor doe he speak from [hi own] inclination.
53|4|it is not but a revel revealed,
53|5|taught to him by one intens in strength -
53|6|one of soundness. and he rose to [his] true form
53|7|whil he wa in the higher [part of the] horizon.
53|8|then he approach and descended
53|9|and wa at a distanc of two bow length or nearer.
53|10|and he reveal to hi servant what he revealed.
53|11|th heart did not lie [about] what it saw.
53|12|so will you disput with him over what he saw?
53|13|and he certainli saw him in anoth descent
53|14|at the lote tree of the utmost boundari -
53|15|near it is the garden of refug -
53|16|when there cover the lote tree that which cover [it].
53|17|th sight [of the prophet] did not swerve, nor did it transgress [it limit].
53|18|h certainli saw of the greatest sign of hi lord.
53|19|so have you consid al-lat and al-'uzza?
53|20|and manat, the third - the other one?
53|21|i the male for you and for him the female?
53|22|that, then, is an unjust division.
53|23|they are not but [mere] name you have name them - you and your forefath - for which allah ha sent down no authority. they follow not except assumpt and what [their] soul desire, and there ha alreadi come to them from their lord guidance.
53|24|or is there for man whatev he wishes?
53|25|rather, to allah belong the hereaft and the first [life].
53|26|and how mani angel there are in the heaven whose intercess will not avail at all except [only] after allah ha permit [it] to whom He will and approves.
53|27|indeed, those who do not believ in the hereaft name the angel femal names,
53|28|and they have thereof no knowledge. they follow not except assumption, and indeed, assumpt avail not against the truth at all.
53|29|so turn away from whoever turn hi back on our messag and desir not except the worldli life.
53|30|that is their sum of knowledge. indeed, your lord is most know of who stray from hi way, and He is most know of who is guided.
53|31|and to allah belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is in the earth - that He may recompens those who do evil with [the penalti of] what they have done and recompens those who do good with the best [reward] -
53|32|those who avoid the major sin and immoralities, onli [committing] slight ones. indeed, your lord is vast in forgiveness. He wa most know of you when He produc you from the earth and when you were fetus in the womb of your mothers. So do not claim yourselv to be pure; He is most know of who fear him.
53|33|hav you seen the one who turn away
53|34|and gave a littl and [then] refrained?
53|35|do he have knowledg of the unseen, so he sees?
53|36|or ha he not been inform of what wa in the scriptur of moses
53|37|and [of] abraham, who fulfil [hi obligations] -
53|38|that no bearer of burden will bear the burden of another
53|39|and that there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives
53|40|and that hi effort is go to be seen -
53|41|then he will be recompens for it with the fullest recompense
53|42|and that to your lord is the finality
53|43|and that it is He who make [one] laugh and weep
53|44|and that it is He who caus death and give life
53|45|and that He creat the two mate - the male and femal -
53|46|from a sperm-drop when it is emitted
53|47|and that [incumbent] upon him is the next creation
53|48|and that it is He who enrich and suffices
53|49|and that it is He who is the lord of sirius
53|50|and that He destroy the first [peopl of] 'aad
53|51|and thamud - and He did not spare [them] -
53|52|and the peopl of noah before. indeed, it wa they who were [even] more unjust and oppressing.
53|53|and the overturn town He hurl down
53|54|and cover them by that which He covered.
53|55|then which of the favor of your lord do you doubt?
53|56|thi [prophet] is a warner like the former warners.
53|57|th approach day ha approached.
53|58|of it, [from those] besid allah, there is no remover.
53|59|then at thi statement do you wonder?
53|60|and you laugh and do not weep
53|61|whil you are proudli sporting?
53|62|so prostrat to allah and worship [him].
54|1|th hour ha come near, and the moon ha split [in two].
54|2|and if they see a miracle, they turn away and say, "pass magic."
54|3|and they deni and follow their inclinations. but for everi matter is a [time of] settlement.
54|4|and there ha alreadi come to them of inform that in which there is deterr -
54|5|extens wisdom - but warn doe not avail [them].
54|6|so leav them, [O muhammad]. the day the caller call to someth forbidding,
54|7|their eye humbled, they will emerg from the grave as if they were locust spreading,
54|8|rac ahead toward the caller. the disbeliev will say, "thi is a difficult day."
54|9|th peopl of noah deni befor them, and they deni our servant and said, "A madman," and he wa repelled.
54|10|so he invok hi lord, "indeed, I am overpowered, so help."
54|11|then We open the gate of the heaven with rain pour down
54|12|and caus the earth to burst with springs, and the water met for a matter alreadi predestined.
54|13|and We carri him on a [construct of] plank and nails,
54|14|sail under our observ as reward for he who had been denied.

54|22|and We have certainli made the qur'an easi for remembrance, so is there ani who will remember?
54|23|thamud deni the warning
54|24|and said, "i it one human be among us that we should follow? indeed, we would then be in error and madness.
54|25|ha the messag been sent down upon him from among us? rather, he is an insol liar."
54|26|they will know tomorrow who is the insol liar.
54|27|indeed, We are send the she-camel as trial for them, so watch them and be patient.
54|28|and inform them that the water is share between them, each [day of] drink attend [bi turn].
54|29|but they call their companion, and he dare and hamstrung [her].
54|30|and how [severe] were My punish and warning.
54|31|indeed, We sent upon them one blast from the sky, and they becam like the dri twig fragment of an [animal] pen.
54|32|and We have certainli made the qur'an easi for remembrance, so is there ani who will remember?
54|33|th peopl of lot deni the warning.
54|34|indeed, We sent upon them a storm of stones, except the famili of lot - We save them befor dawn
54|35|a favor from us. thu do We reward he who is grateful.
54|36|and he had alreadi warn them of our assault, but they disput the warning.
54|37|and they had demand from him hi guests, but We obliter their eyes, [saying], "tast My punish and warning."
54|38|and there came upon them by morn an abid punishment.
54|39|so tast My punish and warning.
54|40|and We have certainli made the qur'an easi for remembrance, so is there ani who will remember?

54|43|ar your disbeliev better than those [former ones], or have you immun in the scripture?
54|44|or do they say, "we are an assembl support [each other]"?
54|45|[their] assembl will be defeated, and they will turn their back [in retreat].
54|46|but the hour is their appoint [for due punishment], and the hour is more disastr and more bitter.
54|47|indeed, the crimin are in error and madness.
54|48|th day they are drag into the fire on their face [it will be said], "tast the touch of saqar."

56|90|and if he wa of the companion of the right,
56|91|then [the angel will say], "peac for you; [you are] from the companion of the right."
56|92|but if he wa of the denier [who were] astray,

57|8|and whi do you not believ in allah while the messeng invit you to believ in your lord and He ha taken your covenant, if you should [truly] be believers?
57|9|it is He who send down upon hi servant [muhammad] vers of clear evid that He may bring you out from dark into the light. and indeed, allah is to you kind and merciful.
57|10|and whi do you not spend in the caus of allah while to allah belong the heritag of the heaven and the earth? not equal among you are those who spent befor the conquest [of makkah] and fought [and those who did so after it]. those are greater in degre than they who spent afterward and fought. but to all allah ha promis the best [reward]. and allah, with what you do, is acquainted.
57|11|who is it that would loan allah a goodli loan so He will multipli it for him and he will have a nobl reward?
57|12|on the day you see the believ men and believ women, their light proceed befor them and on their right, [it will be said], "your good tide today are [of] garden beneath which river flow, wherein you will abid eternally." that is what is the great attainment.
57|13|on the [same] day the hypocrit men and hypocrit women will say to those who believed, "wait for us that we may acquir some of your light." It will be said, "go back behind you and seek light." and a wall will be place between them with a door, it interior contain mercy, but on the outsid of it is torment.
57|14|th hypocrit will call to the believers, "were we not with you?" they will say, "yes, but you afflict yourselv and await [misfortun for us] and doubted, and wish think delud you until there came the command of allah. and the deceiv deceiv you concern allah.
57|15|so today no ransom will be taken from you or from those who disbelieved. your refug is the fire. It is most worthi of you, and wretch is the destination.
57|16|ha the time not come for those who have believ that their heart should becom humbl submiss at the remembr of allah and what ha come down of the truth? and let them not be like those who were given the scriptur before, and a long period pass over them, so their heart hardened; and mani of them are defiantli disobedient.

57|25|w have alreadi sent our messeng with clear evid and sent down with them the scriptur and the balanc that the peopl may maintain [their affairs] in justice. and We sent down iron, wherein is great militari might and benefit for the people, and so that allah may make evid those who support him and hi messeng unseen. indeed, allah is power and exalt in might.
57|26|and We have alreadi sent noah and abraham and place in their descend prophethood and scripture; and among them is he who is guided, but mani of them are defiantli disobedient.
57|27|then We sent follow their footstep our messeng and follow [them] with jesus, the son of mary, and gave him the gospel. and We place in the heart of those who follow him compass and merci and monasticism, which they innovated; We did not prescrib it for them except [that they did so] seek the approv of allah. but they did not observ it with due observance.

58|6|on the day when allah will resurrect them all and inform them of what they did. allah had enumer it, while they forgot it; and allah is, over all things, witness.
58|7|hav you not consid that allah know what is in the heaven and what is on the earth? there is in no privat convers three but that He is the fourth of them, nor are there five but that He is the sixth of them - and no less than that and no more except that He is with them [in knowledge] wherev they are. then He will inform them of what they did, on the day of resurrection. inde allah is, of all things, knowing.
58|8|hav you not consid those who were forbidden from privat conversation, then they return to that which they were forbidden and convers among themselv about sin and aggress and disobedi to the messenger? and when they come to you, they greet you with that [word] by which allah doe not greet you and say among themselves, "whi doe allah not punish us for what we say?" suffici for them is hell, which they will [enter to] burn, and wretch is the destination.
58|9|o you who have believed, when you convers privately, do not convers about sin and aggress and disobedi to the messeng but convers about righteous and piety. and fear allah, to whom you will be gathered.
58|10|priv convers is onli from satan that he may griev those who have believed, but he will not harm them at all except by permiss of allah. and upon allah let the believ rely.

58|12|o you who have believed, when you [wish to] privat consult the messenger, present befor your consult a charity. that is better for you and purer. but if you find not [the means] - then indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
58|13|hav you fear to present befor your consult charities? then when you do not and allah ha forgiven you, then [at least] establish prayer and give zakah and obey allah and hi messenger. and allah is acquaint with what you do.

58|16|they took their [false] oath as a cover, so they avert [people] from the way of allah, and for them is a humili punishment.
58|17|nev will their wealth or their children avail them against allah at all. those are the companion of the fire; they will abid therein eternally
58|18|on the day allah will resurrect them all, and they will swear to him as they swear to you and think that they are [standing] on something. unquestionably, it is they who are the liars.
58|19|satan ha overcom them and made them forget the remembr of allah. those are the parti of satan. unquestionably, the parti of satan - they will be the losers.
58|20|indeed, the one who oppos allah and hi messeng - those will be among the most humbled.

58|22|you will not find a peopl who believ in allah and the last day have affect for those who oppos allah and hi messenger, even if they were their father or their son or their brother or their kindred. those - He ha decre within their heart faith and support them with spirit from him. and We will admit them to garden beneath which river flow, wherein they abid eternally. allah is pleas with them, and they are pleas with him - those are the parti of allah. unquestionably, the parti of allah - they are the successful.
59|1|whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth exalt allah, and He is the exalt in might, the wise.
59|2|it is He who expel the one who disbeliev among the peopl of the scriptur from their home at the first gathering. you did not think they would leave, and they thought that their fortress would protect them from allah; but [the decre of] allah came upon them from where they had not expected, and He cast terror into their heart [so] they destroy their hous by their [own] hand and the hand of the believers. So take warning, O peopl of vision.
59|3|and if not that allah had decre for them evacuation, He would have punish them in [this] world, and for them in the hereaft is the punish of the fire.
59|4|that is becaus they oppos allah and hi messenger. and whoever oppos allah - then indeed, allah is sever in penalty.
59|5|whatev you have cut down of [their] palm tree or left stand on their trunk - it wa by permiss of allah and so He would disgrac the defiantli disobedient.
59|6|and what allah restor [of property] to hi messeng from them - you did not spur for it [in an expedition] ani hors or camels, but allah give hi messeng power over whom He wills, and allah is over all thing competent.
59|7|and what allah restor to hi messeng from the peopl of the town - it is for allah and for the messeng and for [his] near rel and orphan and the [stranded] travel - so that it will not be a perpetu distribut among the rich from among you. and whatev the messeng ha given you - take; and what he ha forbidden you - refrain from. and fear allah; indeed, allah is sever in penalty.
59|8|for the poor emigr who were expel from their home and their properties, seek bounti from allah and [his] approv and support allah and hi messenger, [there is also a share]. those are the truthful.
59|9|and [also for] those who were settl in al-madinah and [adopted] the faith befor them. they love those who emigr to them and find not ani want in their breast of what the emigr were given but give [them] prefer over themselves, even though they are in privation. and whoever is protect from the stingi of hi soul - it is those who will be the successful.
59|10|and [there is a share for] those who came after them, saying, "our lord, forgiv us and our brother who preced us in faith and put not in our heart [any] resent toward those who have believed. our lord, inde you are kind and merciful."
59|11|hav you not consid those who practic hypocrisy, say to their brother who have disbeliev among the peopl of the scripture, "if you are expelled, we will sure leav with you, and we will not obey, in regard to you, anyon - ever; and if you are fought, we will sure aid you." but allah testifi that they are liars.
59|12|if they are expelled, they will not leav with them, and if they are fought, they will not aid them. and [even] if they should aid them, they will sure turn their backs; then [thereafter] they will not be aided.
59|13|y [believers] are more fear within their breast than allah. that is becaus they are a peopl who do not understand.
59|14|they will not fight you all except within fortifi citi or from behind walls. their violenc among themselv is severe. you think they are together, but their heart are diverse. that is becaus they are a peopl who do not reason.
59|15|[their is] like the exampl of those shortli befor them: they tast the bad consequ of their affair, and they will have a pain punishment.
59|16|[th hypocrit are] like the exampl of satan when he say to man, "disbelieve." but when he disbelieves, he says, "indeed, I am disassoci from you. indeed, I fear allah, lord of the worlds."
59|17|so the outcom for both of them is that they will be in the fire, abid etern therein. and that is the recompens of the wrong-doers.
59|18|o you who have believed, fear allah. and let everi soul look to what it ha put forth for tomorrow - and fear allah. indeed, allah is acquaint with what you do.
59|19|and be not like those who forgot allah, so He made them forget themselves. those are the defiantli disobedient.
59|20|not equal are the companion of the fire and the companion of paradise. the companion of paradis - they are the attain [of success].
59|21|if We had sent down thi qur'an upon a mountain, you would have seen it humbl and come apart from fear of allah. and these exampl We present to the peopl that perhap they will give thought.
59|22|h is allah, other than whom there is no deity, knower of the unseen and the witnessed. He is the entir merciful, the especi merciful.
59|23|h is allah, other than whom there is no deity, the sovereign, the pure, the perfection, the bestow of faith, the overseer, the exalt in might, the compeller, the superior. exalt is allah abov whatev they associ with him.
59|24|h is allah, the creator, the inventor, the fashioner; to him belong the best names. whatev is in the heaven and earth is exalt him. and He is the exalt in might, the wise.
60|1|o you who have believed, do not take My enemi and your enemi as allies, extend to them affect while they have disbeliev in what came to you of the truth, have driven out the prophet and yourselv [only] becaus you believ in allah, your lord. If you have come out for jihad in My caus and seek mean to My approval, [take them not as friends]. you confid to them affection, but I am most know of what you have conceal and what you have declared. and whoever doe it among you ha certainli stray from the sound of the way.
60|2|if they gain domin over you, they would be to you as enemi and extend against you their hand and their tongu with evil, and they wish you would disbelieve.
60|3|nev will your rel or your children benefit you; the day of resurrect He will judg between you. and allah, of what you do, is seeing.
60|4|ther ha alreadi been for you an excel pattern in abraham and those with him, when they said to their people, "indeed, we are disassoci from you and from whatev you worship other than allah. We have deni you, and there ha appear between us and you animos and hatr forev until you believ in allah alone" except for the say of abraham to hi father, "I will sure ask forgiv for you, but I have not [power to do] for you anyth against allah. our lord, upon you we have relied, and to you we have returned, and to you is the destination.
60|5|our lord, make us not [object of] torment for the disbeliev and forgiv us, our lord. indeed, it is you who is the exalt in might, the wise."
60|6|ther ha certainli been for you in them an excel pattern for anyon whose hope is in allah and the last day. and whoever turn away - then indeed, allah is the free of need, the praiseworthy.
60|7|perhap allah will put, between you and those to whom you have been enemi among them, affection. and allah is competent, and allah is forgiv and merciful.
60|8|allah doe not forbid you from those who do not fight you becaus of religion and do not expel you from your home - from be righteou toward them and act justli toward them. indeed, allah love those who act justly.
60|9|allah onli forbid you from those who fight you becaus of religion and expel you from your home and aid in your expuls - [forbids] that you make alli of them. and whoever make alli of them, then it is those who are the wrongdoers.
60|10|o you who have believed, when the believ women come to you as emigrants, examin them. allah is most know as to their faith. and if you know them to be believers, then do not return them to the disbelievers; they are not law [wives] for them, nor are they law [husbands] for them. but give the disbeliev what they have spent. and there is no blame upon you if you marri them when you have given them their due compensation. and hold not to marriag bond with disbeliev women, but ask for what you have spent and let them ask for what they have spent. that is the judgement of allah; He judg between you. and allah is know and wise.
60|11|and if you have lost ani of your wive to the disbeliev and you subsequ obtain [something], then give those whose wive have gone the equival of what they had spent. and fear allah, in whom you are believers.
60|12|o prophet, when the believ women come to you pledg to you that they will not associ anyth with allah, nor will they steal, nor will they commit unlaw sexual intercourse, nor will they kill their children, nor will they bring forth a slander they have invent between their arm and legs, nor will they disobey you in what is right - then accept their pledg and ask forgiv for them of allah. indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
60|13|o you who have believed, do not make alli of a peopl with whom allah ha becom angry. they have despair of [reward in] the hereaft just as the disbeliev have despair of [meeting] the inhabit of the graves.
61|1|whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth exalt allah, and He is the exalt in might, the wise.
61|2|o you who have believed, whi do you say what you do not do?
61|3|great is hatr in the sight of allah that you say what you do not do.
61|4|indeed, allah love those who fight in hi caus in a row as though they are a [single] structur join firmly.
61|5|and [mention, O muhammad], when mose said to hi people, "O my people, whi do you harm me while you certainli know that I am the messeng of allah to you?" and when they deviated, allah caus their heart to deviate. and allah doe not guid the defiantli disobedi people.
61|6|and [mention] when jesus, the son of mary, said, "O children of israel, inde I am the messeng of allah to you confirm what came befor me of the torah and bring good tide of a messeng to come after me, whose name is ahmad." but when he came to them with clear evidences, they said, "thi is obviou magic."
61|7|and who is more unjust than one who invent about allah untruth while he is be invit to islam. and allah doe not guid the wrongdo people.
61|8|they want to extinguish the light of allah with their mouths, but allah will perfect hi light, although the disbeliev dislik it.
61|9|it is He who sent hi messeng with guidanc and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion, although those who associ other with allah dislik it.
61|10|o you who have believed, shall I guid you to a transact that will save you from a pain punishment?
61|11|[it is that] you believ in allah and hi messeng and strive in the caus of allah with your wealth and your lives. that is best for you, if you should know.
61|12|h will forgiv for you your sin and admit you to garden beneath which river flow and pleasant dwell in garden of perpetu residence. that is the great attainment.
61|13|and [you will obtain] anoth [favor] that you love - victori from allah and an immin conquest; and give good tide to the believers.
61|14|o you who have believed, be support of allah, as when jesus, the son of mary, said to the disciples, "who are my support for allah?" the discipl said, "we are support of allah." and a faction of the children of israel believ and a faction disbelieved. So We support those who believ against their enemy, and they becam dominant.
62|1|whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth is exalt allah, the sovereign, the pure, the exalt in might, the wise.
62|2|it is He who ha sent among the unlett a messeng from themselv recit to them hi vers and purifi them and teach them the book and wisdom - although they were befor in clear error -
62|3|and [to] other of them who have not yet join them. and He is the exalt in might, the wise.
62|4|that is the bounti of allah, which He give to whom He wills, and allah is the possessor of great bounty.
62|5|th exampl of those who were entrust with the torah and then did not take it on is like that of a donkey who carri volum [of books]. wretch is the exampl of the peopl who deni the sign of allah. and allah doe not guid the wrongdo people.
62|6|say, "O you who are jews, if you claim that you are alli of allah, exclud the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful."
62|7|but they will not wish for it, ever, becaus of what their hand have put forth. and allah is know of the wrongdoers.
62|8|say, "indeed, the death from which you flee - indeed, it will meet you. then you will be return to the knower of the unseen and the witnessed, and He will inform you about what you use to do."
62|9|o you who have believed, when [the adhan] is call for the prayer on the day of jumu'ah [friday], then proceed to the remembr of allah and leav trade. that is better for you, if you onli knew.
62|10|and when the prayer ha been concluded, dispers within the land and seek from the bounti of allah, and rememb allah often that you may succeed.
62|11|but when they saw a transact or a diversion, [O muhammad], they rush to it and left you standing. say, "what is with allah is better than divers and than a transaction, and allah is the best of providers."
63|1|when the hypocrit come to you, [O muhammad], they say, "we testifi that you are the messeng of allah." and allah know that you are hi messenger, and allah testifi that the hypocrit are liars.
63|2|they have taken their oath as a cover, so they avert [people] from the way of allah. indeed, it wa evil that they were doing.
63|3|that is becaus they believed, and then they disbelieved; so their heart were seal over, and they do not understand.
63|4|and when you see them, their form pleas you, and if they speak, you listen to their speech. [they are] as if they were piec of wood prop up - they think that everi shout is against them. they are the enemy, so bewar of them. may allah destroy them; how are they deluded?
63|5|and when it is said to them, "come, the messeng of allah will ask forgiv for you," they turn their head asid and you see them evad while they are arrogant.
63|6|it is all the same for them whether you ask forgiv for them or do not ask forgiv for them; never will allah forgiv them. indeed, allah doe not guid the defiantli disobedi people.
63|7|they are the one who say, "do not spend on those who are with the messeng of allah until they disband." and to allah belong the depositori of the heaven and the earth, but the hypocrit do not understand.
63|8|they say, "if we return to al-madinah, the more honor [for power] will sure expel therefrom the more humble." and to allah belong [all] honor, and to hi messenger, and to the believers, but the hypocrit do not know.
63|9|o you who have believed, let not your wealth and your children divert you from remembr of allah. and whoever doe that - then those are the losers.
63|10|and spend [in the way of allah] from what We have provid you befor death approach one of you and he says, "mi lord, if onli you would delay me for a brief term so I would give chariti and be among the righteous."
63|11|but never will allah delay a soul when it time ha come. and allah is acquaint with what you do.
64|1|whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth is exalt allah. To him belong dominion, and to him belong [all] praise, and He is over all thing competent.
64|2|it is He who creat you, and among you is the disbeliever, and among you is the believer. and allah, of what you do, is seeing.
64|3|h creat the heaven and earth in truth and form you and perfect your forms; and to him is the [final] destination.
64|4|h know what is within the heaven and earth and know what you conceal and what you declare. and allah is know of that within the breasts.
64|5|ha there not come to you the news of those who disbeliev before? So they tast the bad consequ of their affair, and they will have a pain punishment.
64|6|that is becaus their messeng use to come to them with clear evidences, but they said, "shall human be guid us?" and disbeliev and turn away. and allah dispens [with them]; and allah is free of need and praiseworthy.
64|7|thos who disbeliev have claim that they will never be resurrected. say, "yes, by my lord, you will sure be resurrected; then you will sure be inform of what you did. and that, for allah, is easy."
64|8|so believ in allah and hi messeng and the qur'an which We have sent down. and allah is acquaint with what you do.
64|9|th day He will assembl you for the day of assembl - that is the day of deprivation. and whoever believ in allah and doe righteous - He will remov from him hi misde and admit him to garden beneath which river flow, wherein they will abid forever. that is the great attainment.
64|10|but the one who disbeliev and deni our vers - those are the companion of the fire, abid etern therein; and wretch is the destination.
64|11|no disast strike except by permiss of allah. and whoever believ in allah - He will guid hi heart. and allah is know of all things.
64|12|and obey allah and obey the messenger; but if you turn away - then upon our messeng is onli [the duti of] clear notification.
64|13|allah - there is no deiti except him. and upon allah let the believ rely.
64|14|o you who have believed, indeed, among your wive and your children are enemi to you, so bewar of them. but if you pardon and overlook and forgiv - then indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
64|15|your wealth and your children are but a trial, and allah ha with him a great reward.
64|16|so fear allah as much as you are abl and listen and obey and spend [in the way of allah]; it is better for your selves. and whoever is protect from the stingi of hi soul - it is those who will be the successful.
64|17|if you loan allah a goodli loan, He will multipli it for you and forgiv you. and allah is most appreci and forbearing.
64|18|know of the unseen and the witnessed, the exalt in might, the wise.
65|1|o prophet, when you [muslims] divorc women, divorc them for [the commenc of] their wait period and keep count of the wait period, and fear allah, your lord. Do not turn them out of their [husbands'] houses, nor should they [themselves] leav [dure that period] unless they are commit a clear immorality. and those are the limit [set by] allah. and whoever transgress the limit of allah ha certainli wrong himself. you know not; perhap allah will bring about after that a [different] matter.
65|2|and when they have [nearly] fulfil their term, either retain them accord to accept term or part with them accord to accept terms. and bring to wit two just men from among you and establish the testimoni for [the accept of] allah. that is instruct to whoever should believ in allah and the last day. and whoever fear allah - He will make for him a way out
65|3|and will provid for him from where he doe not expect. and whoever reli upon allah - then He is suffici for him. indeed, allah will accomplish hi purpose. allah ha alreadi set for everyth a [decreed] extent.
65|4|and those who no longer expect menstruat among your women - if you doubt, then their period is three months, and [also for] those who have not menstruated. and for those who are pregnant, their term is until they give birth. and whoever fear allah - He will make for him of hi matter ease.
65|5|that is the command of allah, which He ha sent down to you; and whoever fear allah - He will remov for him hi misde and make great for him hi reward.
65|6|lodg them [in a section] of where you dwell out of your mean and do not harm them in order to oppress them. and if they should be pregnant, then spend on them until they give birth. and if they breastfe for you, then give them their payment and confer among yourselv in the accept way; but if you are in discord, then there may breastfe for the father anoth woman.
65|7|let a man of wealth spend from hi wealth, and he whose provis is restrict - let him spend from what allah ha given him. allah doe not charg a soul except [accord to] what He ha given it. allah will bring about, after hardship, ease.
65|8|and how mani a citi wa insol toward the command of it lord and hi messengers, so We took it to sever account and punish it with a terribl punishment.
65|9|and it tast the bad consequ of it affair, and the outcom of it affair wa loss.
65|10|allah ha prepar for them a sever punishment; so fear allah, O you of understand who have believed. allah ha sent down to you the qur'an.
65|11|[h sent] a messeng [muhammad] recit to you the distinct vers of allah that He may bring out those who believ and do righteou deed from dark into the light. and whoever believ in allah and doe righteous - He will admit him into garden beneath which river flow to abid therein forever. allah will have perfect for him a provision.
65|12|it is allah who ha creat seven heaven and of the earth, the like of them. [his] command descend among them so you may know that allah is over all thing compet and that allah ha encompass all thing in knowledge.
66|1|o prophet, whi do you prohibit [yourself from] what allah ha made law for you, seek the approv of your wives? and allah is forgiv and merciful.
66|2|allah ha alreadi ordain for you [muslims] the dissolut of your oaths. and allah is your protector, and He is the knowing, the wise.
66|3|and [remember] when the prophet confid to one of hi wive a statement; and when she inform [another] of it and allah show it to him, he made known part of it and ignor a part. and when he inform her about it, she said, "who told you this?" He said, "I wa inform by the knowing, the acquainted."
66|4|if you two [wives] repent to allah, [it is best], for your heart have deviated. but if you cooper against him - then inde allah is hi protector, and gabriel and the righteou of the believ and the angels, moreover, are [his] assistants.
66|5|perhap hi lord, if he divorc you [all], would substitut for him wive better than you - submit [to allah], believing, devoutli obedient, repentant, worshipping, and travel - [ones] previous marri and virgins.
66|6|o you who have believed, protect yourselv and your famili from a fire whose fuel is peopl and stones, over which are [appointed] angels, harsh and severe; they do not disobey allah in what He command them but do what they are commanded.
66|7|o you who have disbelieved, make no excus that day. you will onli be recompens for what you use to do.
66|8|o you who have believed, repent to allah with sincer repentance. perhap your lord will remov from you your misde and admit you into garden beneath which river flow [on] the day when allah will not disgrac the prophet and those who believ with him. their light will proceed befor them and on their right; they will say, "our lord, perfect for us our light and forgiv us. indeed, you are over all thing competent."
66|9|o prophet, strive against the disbeliev and the hypocrit and be harsh upon them. and their refug is hell, and wretch is the destination.
66|10|allah present an exampl of those who disbelieved: the wife of noah and the wife of lot. they were under two of our righteou servant but betray them, so those prophet did not avail them from allah at all, and it wa said, "enter the fire with those who enter."
66|11|and allah present an exampl of those who believed: the wife of pharaoh, when she said, "mi lord, build for me near you a hous in paradis and save me from pharaoh and hi deed and save me from the wrongdo people."
66|12|and [the exampl of] mary, the daughter of 'imran, who guard her chastity, so We blew into [her garment] through our angel, and she believ in the word of her lord and hi scriptur and wa of the devoutli obedient.
67|1|bless is He in whose hand is dominion, and He is over all thing compet -
67|2|[he] who creat death and life to test you [a to] which of you is best in deed - and He is the exalt in might, the forgiv -
67|3|[and] who creat seven heaven in layers. you do not see in the creation of the most merci ani inconsistency. So return [your] vision [to the sky]; do you see ani breaks?
67|4|then return [your] vision twice again. [your] vision will return to you humbl while it is fatigued.
67|5|and We have certainli beautifi the nearest heaven with star and have made [from] them what is thrown at the devil and have prepar for them the punish of the blaze.
67|6|and for those who disbeliev in their lord is the punish of hell, and wretch is the destination.
67|7|when they are thrown into it, they hear from it a [dreadful] inhal while it boil up.
67|8|it almost burst with rage. everi time a compani is thrown into it, it keeper ask them, "did there not come to you a warner?"
67|9|they will say," yes, a warner had come to us, but we deni and said, 'allah ha not sent down anything. you are not but in great error.'"
67|10|and they will say, "if onli we had been listen or reasoning, we would not be among the companion of the blaze."
67|11|and they will admit their sin, so [it is] alien for the companion of the blaze.
67|12|indeed, those who fear their lord unseen will have forgiv and great reward.
67|13|and conceal your speech or public it; indeed, He is know of that within the breasts.
67|14|do He who creat not know, while He is the subtle, the acquainted?
67|15|it is He who made the earth tame for you - so walk among it slope and eat of hi provis - and to him is the resurrection.
67|16|do you feel secur that He who [hold authority] in the heaven would not caus the earth to swallow you and suddenli it would sway?
67|17|or do you feel secur that He who [hold authority] in the heaven would not send against you a storm of stones? then you would know how [severe] wa My warning.
67|18|and alreadi had those befor them denied, and how [terrible] wa My reproach.
67|19|do they not see the bird abov them with wing outspread and [sometimes] fold in? none hold them [aloft] except the most merciful. inde He is, of all things, seeing.
67|20|or who is it that could be an armi for you to aid you other than the most merciful? the disbeliev are not but in delusion.
67|21|or who is it that could provid for you if He withheld hi provision? but they have persist in insol and aversion.
67|22|then is one who walk fallen on hi face better guid or one who walk erect on a straight path?
67|23|say, "it is He who ha produc you and made for you hear and vision and hearts; littl are you grateful."
67|24|say, "it is He who ha multipli you throughout the earth, and to him you will be gathered."
67|25|and they say, "when is thi promise, if you should be truthful?"
67|26|say, "the knowledg is onli with allah, and I am onli a clear warner."
67|27|but when they see it approaching, the face of those who disbeliev will be distressed, and it will be said, "thi is that for which you use to call."
67|28|say, [O muhammad], "have you considered: whether allah should caus my death and those with me or have merci upon us, who can protect the disbeliev from a pain punishment?"
67|29|say, "he is the most merciful; we have believ in him, and upon him we have relied. and you will [come to] know who it is that is in clear error."
67|30|say, "have you considered: if your water wa to becom sunken [into the earth], then who could bring you flow water?"
68|1|nun. By the pen and what they inscribe,
68|2|y are not, [O muhammad], by the favor of your lord, a madman.
68|3|and indeed, for you is a reward uninterrupted.
68|4|and indeed, you are of a great moral character.
68|5|so you will see and they will see
68|6|which of you is the afflict [bi a devil].
68|7|indeed, your lord is most know of who ha gone astray from hi way, and He is most know of the [rightly] guided.
68|8|then do not obey the deniers.
68|9|they wish that you would soften [in your position], so they would soften [toward you].
68|10|and do not obey everi worthless habitu swearer
68|11|[and] scorner, go about with malici gossip -
68|12|a prevent of good, transgress and sinful,
68|13|cruel, moreover, and an illegitim pretender.
68|14|becaus he is a possessor of wealth and children,
68|15|when our vers are recit to him, he says, "legend of the former peoples."
68|16|w will brand him upon the snout.
68|17|indeed, We have tri them as We tri the companion of the garden, when they swore to cut it fruit in the [early] morning
68|18|without make exception.
68|19|so there came upon the garden an afflict from your lord while they were asleep.
68|20|and it becam as though reaped.
68|21|and they call one anoth at morning,
68|22|[saying], "go earli to your crop if you would cut the fruit."
68|23|so they set out, while lower their voices,
68|24|[saying], "there will sure not enter it today upon you [any] poor person."
68|25|and they went earli in determination, [assum themselves] able.
68|26|but when they saw it, they said, "indeed, we are lost;
68|27|rather, we have been deprived."
68|28|th most moder of them said, "did I not say to you, 'whi do you not exalt [allah]?' "
68|29|they said, "exalt is our lord! indeed, we were wrongdoers."
68|30|then they approach one another, blame each other.
68|31|they said, "O woe to us; inde we were transgressors.
68|32|perhap our lord will substitut for us [one] better than it. indeed, we are toward our lord desirous."
68|33|such is the punish [of thi world]. and the punish of the hereaft is greater, if they onli knew.
68|34|indeed, for the righteou with their lord are the garden of pleasure.
68|35|then will We treat the muslim like the criminals?
68|36|what is [the matter] with you? how do you judge?
68|37|or do you have a scriptur in which you learn
68|38|that inde for you is whatev you choose?
68|39|or do you have oath [binding] upon us, extend until the day of resurrection, that inde for you is whatev you judge?
68|40|ask them which of them, for that [claim], is responsible.
68|41|or do they have partners? then let them bring their partners, if they should be truthful.
68|42|th day the shin will be uncov and they are invit to prostrat but the disbeliev will not be able,
68|43|their eye humbled, humili will cover them. and they use to be invit to prostrat while they were sound.
68|44|so leav me, [O muhammad], with [the matter of] whoever deni the qur'an. We will progress lead them [to punishment] from where they do not know.
68|45|and I will give them time. indeed, My plan is firm.
68|46|or do you ask of them a payment, so they are by debt burden down?
68|47|or have they [knowledg of] the unseen, so they write [it] down?
68|48|then be patient for the decis of your lord, [O muhammad], and be not like the companion of the fish when he call out while he wa distressed.
68|49|if not that a favor from hi lord overtook him, he would have been thrown onto the nake shore while he wa censured.
68|50|and hi lord chose him and made him of the righteous.
68|51|and indeed, those who disbeliev would almost make you slip with their eye when they hear the message, and they say, "indeed, he is mad."
68|52|but it is not except a remind to the worlds.
69|1|th inevit realiti -
69|2|what is the inevit reality?
69|3|and what can make you know what is the inevit reality?
69|4|thamud and 'aad deni the strike calamity.
69|5|so as for thamud, they were destroy by the overpow [blast].
69|6|and as for 'aad, they were destroy by a screaming, violent wind
69|7|which allah impos upon them for seven night and eight day in succession, so you would see the peopl therein fallen as if they were hollow trunk of palm trees.
69|8|then do you see of them ani remains?
69|9|and there came pharaoh and those befor him and the overturn citi with sin.
69|10|and they disobey the messeng of their lord, so He seiz them with a seizur exceed [in severity].
69|11|indeed, when the water overflowed, We carri your ancestor in the sail ship
69|12|that We might make it for you a remind and [that] a consciou ear would be consciou of it.
69|13|then when the horn is blown with one blast
69|14|and the earth and the mountain are lift and level with one blow -
69|15|then on that day, the resurrect will occur,
69|16|and the heaven will split [open], for that day it is infirm.
69|17|and the angel are at it edges. and there will bear the throne of your lord abov them, that day, eight [of them].
69|18|that day, you will be exhibit [for judgement]; not hidden among you is anyth concealed.
69|19|so as for he who is given hi record in hi right hand, he will say, "here, read my record!
69|20|indeed, I wa certain that I would be meet my account."
69|21|so he will be in a pleasant life -
69|22|in an elev garden,
69|23|it [fruit] to be pick hang near.
69|24|[they will be told], "eat and drink in satisfact for what you put forth in the day past."
69|25|but as for he who is given hi record in hi left hand, he will say, "oh, I wish I had not been given my record
69|26|and had not known what is my account.
69|27|i wish my death had been the decis one.
69|28|mi wealth ha not avail me.
69|29|gon from me is my authority."
69|30|[allah will say], "seiz him and shackl him.
69|31|then into hellfir drive him.
69|32|then into a chain whose length is seventi cubit insert him."
69|33|indeed, he did not use to believ in allah, the most great,
69|34|nor did he encourag the feed of the poor.
69|35|so there is not for him here thi day ani devot friend
69|36|nor ani food except from the discharg of wounds;
69|37|non will eat it except the sinners.
69|38|so I swear by what you see
69|39|and what you do not see
69|40|[that] indeed, the qur'an is the word of a nobl messenger.
69|41|and it is not the word of a poet; littl do you believe.
69|42|nor the word of a soothsayer; littl do you remember.
69|43|[it is] a revel from the lord of the worlds.
69|44|and if muhammad had made up about Us some [false] sayings,
69|45|w would have seiz him by the right hand;
69|46|then We would have cut from him the aorta.
69|47|and there is no one of you who could prevent [us] from him.
69|48|and indeed, the qur'an is a remind for the righteous.
69|49|and indeed, We know that among you are deniers.
69|50|and indeed, it will be [a caus of] regret upon the disbelievers.
69|51|and indeed, it is the truth of certainty.
69|52|so exalt the name of your lord, the most great.
70|1|a supplic ask for a punish bound to happen
70|2|to the disbelievers; of it there is no preventer.
70|3|[it is] from allah, owner of the way of ascent.
70|4|th angel and the spirit will ascend to him dure a day the extent of which is fifti thousand years.
70|5|so be patient with graciou patience.
70|6|indeed, they see it [as] distant,
70|7|but We see it [as] near.
70|8|on the day the sky will be like murki oil,
70|9|and the mountain will be like wool,
70|10|and no friend will ask [anyth of] a friend,
70|11|they will be shown each other. the crimin will wish that he could be ransom from the punish of that day by hi children
70|12|and hi wife and hi brother
70|13|and hi nearest kindr who shelter him
70|14|and whoever is on earth entir [so] then it could save him.
70|15|no! indeed, it is the flame [of hell],
70|16|a remov of exteriors.
70|17|it invit he who turn hi back [on truth] and went away [from obedience]
70|18|and collect [wealth] and hoarded.
70|19|indeed, mankind wa creat anxious:
70|20|when evil touch him, impatient,
70|21|and when good touch him, withhold [of it],
70|22|except the observ of prayer -
70|23|those who are constant in their prayer
70|24|and those within whose wealth is a known right
70|25|for the petition and the depriv -
70|26|and those who believ in the day of recompense
70|27|and those who are fear of the punish of their lord -
70|28|indeed, the punish of their lord is not that from which one is safe -
70|29|and those who guard their privat parts
70|30|except from their wive or those their right hand possess, for indeed, they are not to be blame -
70|31|but whoever seek beyond that, then they are the transgressor -
70|32|and those who are to their trust and promis attentive
70|33|and those who are in their testimoni upright
70|34|and those who [carefully] maintain their prayer:
70|35|they will be in gardens, honored.
70|36|so what is [the matter] with those who disbelieve, hasten [from] befor you, [O muhammad],
70|37|[to sit] on [your] right and [your] left in separ groups?
70|38|do everi person among them aspir to enter a garden of pleasure?
70|39|no! indeed, We have creat them from that which they know.
70|40|so I swear by the lord of [all] rise and set that inde We are able
70|41|to replac them with better than them; and We are not to be outdone.
70|42|so leav them to convers vainli and amus themselv until they meet their day which they are promis -
70|43|the day they will emerg from the grave rapidli as if they were, toward an erect idol, hastening.
70|44|their eye humbled, humili will cover them. that is the day which they had been promised.
71|1|indeed, We sent noah to hi people, [saying], "warn your peopl befor there come to them a pain punishment."
71|2|h said, "O my people, inde I am to you a clear warner,
71|3|[saying], 'worship allah, fear him and obey me.
71|4|allah will forgiv you of your sin and delay you for a specifi term. indeed, the time [set by] allah, when it comes, will not be delayed, if you onli knew.' "
71|5|he said, "mi lord, inde I invit my peopl [to truth] night and day.
71|6|but my invit increas them not except in flight.
71|7|and indeed, everi time I invit them that you may forgiv them, they put their finger in their ears, cover themselv with their garments, persisted, and were arrog with [great] arrogance.
71|8|then I invit them publicly.
71|9|then I announc to them and [also] confid to them secretly
71|10|and said, 'ask forgiv of your lord. indeed, He is ever a perpetu forgiver.
71|11|h will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers
71|12|and give you increas in wealth and children and provid for you garden and provid for you rivers.
71|13|what is [the matter] with you that you do not attribut to allah [due] grandeur
71|14|whil He ha creat you in stages?
71|15|do you not consid how allah ha creat seven heaven in layers
71|16|and made the moon therein a [reflected] light and made the sun a burn lamp?
71|17|and allah ha caus you to grow from the earth a [progressive] growth.
71|18|then He will return you into it and extract you [another] extraction.
71|19|and allah ha made for you the earth an expanse
71|20|that you may follow therein road of passage.' "
71|21|noah said, "mi lord, inde they have disobey me and follow him whose wealth and children will not increas him except in loss.
71|22|and they conspir an immens conspiracy.
71|23|and said, 'never leav your god and never leav wadd or suwa' or yaghuth and ya'uq and nasr.
71|24|and alreadi they have misl many. and, [mi lord], do not increas the wrongdoer except in error."
71|25|becaus of their sin they were drown and put into the fire, and they found not for themselv besid allah [any] helpers.
71|26|and noah said, "mi lord, do not leav upon the earth from among the disbeliev an inhabitant.
71|27|indeed, if you leav them, they will mislead your servant and not beget except [every] wick one and [confirmed] disbeliever.
71|28|mi lord, forgiv me and my parent and whoever enter my hous a believ and the believ men and believ women. and do not increas the wrongdoer except in destruction."
72|1|say, [O muhammad], "it ha been reveal to me that a group of the jinn listen and said, 'indeed, we have heard an amaz qur'an.
72|2|it guid to the right course, and we have believ in it. and we will never associ with our lord anyone.
72|3|and [it teaches] that exalt is the nobl of our lord; He ha not taken a wife or a son
72|4|and that our foolish one ha been say about allah an excess transgression.
72|5|and we had thought that mankind and the jinn would never speak about allah a lie.
72|6|and there were men from mankind who sought refug in men from the jinn, so they [only] increas them in burden.
72|7|and they had thought, as you thought, that allah would never send anyon [a a messenger].
72|8|and we have sought [to reach] the heaven but found it fill with power guard and burn flames.
72|9|and we use to sit therein in posit for hearing, but whoever listen now will find a burn flame lie in wait for him.
72|10|and we do not know [therefore] whether evil is intend for those on earth or whether their lord intend for them a right course.
72|11|and among us are the righteous, and among us are [others] not so; we were [of] divid ways.
72|12|and we have becom certain that we will never caus failur to allah upon earth, nor can we escap him by flight.
72|13|and when we heard the guidance, we believ in it. and whoever believ in hi lord will not fear depriv or burden.
72|14|and among us are muslim [in submiss to allah], and among us are the unjust. and whoever ha becom muslim - those have sought out the right course.
72|15|but as for the unjust, they will be, for hell, firewood.'
72|16|and [allah revealed] that if they had remain straight on the way, We would have given them abund provision
72|17|so We might test them therein. and whoever turn away from the remembr of hi lord He will put into arduou punishment.
72|18|and [he revealed] that the masjid are for allah, so do not invok with allah anyone.
72|19|and that when the servant of allah stood up supplic him, they almost becam about him a compact mass."
72|20|say, [O muhammad], "I onli invok my lord and do not associ with him anyone."
72|21|say, "indeed, I do not possess for you [the power of] harm or right direction."
72|22|say, "indeed, there will never protect me from allah anyon [if I should disobey], nor will I find in other than him a refuge.
72|23|but [I have for you] onli notif from allah, and hi messages." and whoever disobey allah and hi messeng - then indeed, for him is the fire of hell; they will abid therein forever.
72|24|[th disbeliev continue] until, when they see that which they are promised, then they will know who is weaker in helper and less in number.
72|25|say, "I do not know if what you are promis is near or if my lord will grant for it a [long] period."
72|26|[h is] knower of the unseen, and He doe not disclos hi [knowledg of the] unseen to anyone
72|27|except whom He ha approv of messengers, and indeed, He send befor each messeng and behind him observers
72|28|that he may know that they have convey the messag of their lord; and He ha encompass whatev is with them and ha enumer all thing in number.
73|1|o you who wrap himself [in clothing],
73|2|aris [to pray] the night, except for a littl -
73|3|half of it - or subtract from it a little
73|4|or add to it, and recit the qur'an with measur recitation.
73|5|indeed, We will cast upon you a heavi word.
73|6|indeed, the hour of the night are more effect for concurr [of heart and tongue] and more suitabl for words.
73|7|indeed, for you by day is prolong occupation.
73|8|and rememb the name of your lord and devot yourself to him with [complete] devotion.
73|9|[h is] the lord of the east and the west; there is no deiti except him, so take him as dispos of [your] affairs.
73|10|and be patient over what they say and avoid them with graciou avoidance.
73|11|and leav Me with [the matter of] the deniers, those of eas [in life], and allow them respit a little.
73|12|indeed, with Us [for them] are shackl and burn fire
73|13|and food that choke and a pain punish -
73|14|on the day the earth and the mountain will convuls and the mountain will becom a heap of sand pour down.
73|15|indeed, We have sent to you a messeng as a wit upon you just as We sent to pharaoh a messenger.
73|16|but pharaoh disobey the messenger, so We seiz him with a ruinou seizure.
73|17|then how can you fear, if you disbelieve, a day that will make the children white- haired?
73|18|th heaven will break apart therefrom; ever is hi promis fulfilled.
73|19|indeed, thi is a reminder, so whoever will may take to hi lord a way.
73|20|indeed, your lord knows, [O muhammad], that you stand [in prayer] almost two third of the night or half of it or a third of it, and [so do] a group of those with you. and allah determin [the extent of] the night and the day. He ha known that you [muslims] will not be abl to do it and ha turn to you in forgiveness, so recit what is easi [for you] of the qur'an. He ha known that there will be among you those who are ill and other travel throughout the land seek [something] of the bounti of allah and other fight for the caus of allah. So recit what is easi from it and establish prayer and give zakah and loan allah a goodli loan. and whatev good you put forward for yourselv - you will find it with allah. It is better and greater in reward. and seek forgiv of allah. indeed, allah is forgiv and merciful.
74|1|o you who cover himself [with a garment],
74|2|aris and warn
74|3|and your lord glorify
74|4|and your cloth purify
74|5|and uncleanli avoid
74|6|and do not confer favor to acquir more
74|7|but for your lord be patient.
74|8|and when the trumpet is blown,
74|9|that day will be a difficult day
74|10|for the disbeliev - not easy.
74|11|leav Me with the one I creat alone
74|12|and to whom I grant extens wealth
74|13|and children present [with him]
74|14|and spread [everything] befor him, eas [hi life].
74|15|then he desir that I should add more.
74|16|no! indeed, he ha been toward our vers obstinate.
74|17|i will cover him with arduou torment.
74|18|indeed, he thought and deliberated.
74|19|so may he be destroy [for] how he deliberated.
74|20|then may he be destroy [for] how he deliberated.
74|21|then he consid [again];
74|22|then he frown and scowled;
74|23|then he turn back and wa arrogant
74|24|and said, "thi is not but magic imit [from others].
74|25|thi is not but the word of a human being."
74|26|i will drive him into saqar.
74|27|and what can make you know what is saqar?
74|28|it let noth remain and leav noth [unburned],
74|29|blacken the skins.
74|30|ov it are nineteen [angels].
74|31|and We have not made the keeper of the fire except angels. and We have not made their number except as a trial for those who disbeliev - that those who were given the scriptur will be convinc and those who have believ will increas in faith and those who were given the scriptur and the believ will not doubt and that those in whose heart is hypocrisi and the disbeliev will say, "what doe allah intend by thi as an example?" thu doe allah leav astray whom He will and guid whom He wills. and none know the soldier of your lord except him. and mention of the fire is not but a remind to humanity.
74|32|no! By the moon
74|33|and [by] the night when it departs
74|34|and [by] the morn when it brightens,
74|35|indeed, the fire is of the greatest [afflictions]
74|36|a a warn to human -
74|37|to whoever will among you to proceed or stay behind.
74|38|everi soul, for what it ha earned, will be retained
74|39|except the companion of the right,
74|40|[who will be] in gardens, question each other
74|41|about the criminals,
74|42|[and ask them], "what put you into saqar?"
74|43|they will say, "we were not of those who prayed,
74|44|nor did we use to feed the poor.
74|45|and we use to enter into vain discours with those who engag [in it],
74|46|and we use to deni the day of recompense
74|47|until there came to us the certainty."
74|48|so there will not benefit them the intercess of [any] intercessors.
74|49|then what is [the matter] with them that they are, from the reminder, turn away
74|50|a if they were alarm donkeys
74|51|fle from a lion?
74|52|rather, everi person among them desir that he would be given scriptur spread about.
74|53|no! but they do not fear the hereafter.
74|54|no! indeed, the qur'an is a reminder
74|55|then whoever will will rememb it.
74|56|and they will not rememb except that allah wills. He is worthi of fear and adequ for [granting] forgiveness.
75|1|i swear by the day of resurrection
75|2|and I swear by the reproach soul [to the certainti of resurrection].
75|3|do man think that We will not assembl hi bones?
75|4|yes. [we are] abl [even] to proport hi fingertips.
75|5|but man desir to continu in sin.
75|6|h asks, "when is the day of resurrection?"
75|7|so when vision is dazzled
75|8|and the moon darkens
75|9|and the sun and the moon are joined,
75|10|man will say on that day, "where is the [place of] escape?"
75|11|no! there is no refuge.
75|12|to your lord, that day, is the [place of] permanence.
75|13|man will be inform that day of what he sent ahead and kept back.
75|14|rather, man, against himself, will be a witness,
75|15|even if he present hi excuses.
75|16|mov not your tongu with it, [O muhammad], to hasten with recit of the qur'an.
75|17|indeed, upon Us is it collect [in your heart] and [to make possible] it recitation.
75|18|so when We have recit it [through gabriel], then follow it recitation.
75|19|then upon Us is it clarif [to you].
75|20|no! but you love the immediate
75|21|and leav the hereafter.
75|22|[some] faces, that day, will be radiant,
75|23|look at their lord.
75|24|and [some] faces, that day, will be contorted,
75|25|expect that there will be done to them [something] backbreaking.
75|26|no! when the soul ha reach the collar bones
75|27|and it is said, "who will cure [him]?"
75|28|and the die one is certain that it is the [time of] separation
75|29|and the leg is wound about the leg,
75|30|to your lord, that day, will be the procession.
75|31|and the disbeliev had not believed, nor had he prayed.
75|32|but [instead], he deni and turn away.
75|33|and then he went to hi people, swagger [in pride].
75|34|wo to you, and woe!
75|35|then woe to you, and woe!
75|36|do man think that he will be left neglected?
75|37|had he not been a sperm from semen emitted?
75|38|then he wa a cling clot, and [allah] creat [hi form] and proport [him]
75|39|and made of him two mates, the male and the female.
75|40|i not that [creator] abl to give life to the dead?
76|1|ha there [not] come upon man a period of time when he wa not a thing [even] mentioned?
76|2|indeed, We creat man from a sperm-drop mixtur that We may tri him; and We made him hear and seeing.
76|3|indeed, We guid him to the way, be he grate or be he ungrateful.
76|4|indeed, We have prepar for the disbeliev chain and shackl and a blaze.
76|5|indeed, the righteou will drink from a cup [of wine] whose mixtur is of kafur,
76|6|a spring of which the [righteous] servant of allah will drink; they will make it gush forth in forc [and abundance].
76|7|they [are those who] fulfil [their] vow and fear a day whose evil will be widespread.
76|8|and they give food in spite of love for it to the needy, the orphan, and the captive,
76|9|[saying], "we feed you onli for the counten of allah. We wish not from you reward or gratitude.
76|10|indeed, We fear from our lord a day auster and distressful."
76|11|so allah will protect them from the evil of that day and give them radianc and happiness
76|12|and will reward them for what they patient endur [with] a garden [in paradise] and silk [garments].
76|13|[they will be] reclin therein on adorn couches. they will not see therein ani [burning] sun or [freezing] cold.

76|22|[and it will be said], "indeed, thi is for you a reward, and your effort ha been appreciated."
76|23|indeed, it is We who have sent down to you, [O muhammad], the qur'an progressively.
76|24|so be patient for the decis of your lord and do not obey from among them a sinner or ungrat [disbeliever].
76|25|and mention the name of your lord [in prayer] morn and evening
76|26|and dure the night prostrat to him and exalt him a long [part of the] night.
76|27|indeed, these [disbelievers] love the immedi and leav behind them a grave day.
76|28|w have creat them and strengthen their forms, and when We will, We can chang their like with [complete] alteration.
76|29|indeed, thi is a reminder, so he who will may take to hi lord a way.

77|34|woe, that day, to the deniers.
77|35|thi is a day they will not speak,

77|47|woe, that day, to the deniers.
77|48|and when it is said to them, "bow [in prayer]," they do not bow.
77|49|woe, that day, to the deniers.
77|50|then in what statement after the qur'an will they believe?
78|1|about what are they ask one another?
78|2|about the great news -
78|3|that over which they are in disagreement.
78|4|no! they are go to know.
78|5|then, no! they are go to know.
78|6|hav We not made the earth a rest place?

78|14|and sent down, from the rain clouds, pour water
78|15|that We may bring forth therebi grain and vegetation
78|16|and garden of entwin growth.
78|17|indeed, the day of judgement is an appoint time -
78|18|the day the horn is blown and you will come forth in multitudes
78|19|and the heaven is open and will becom gateways
78|20|and the mountain are remov and will be [but] a mirage.
78|21|indeed, hell ha been lie in wait
78|22|for the transgressors, a place of return,
78|23|in which they will remain for age [unending].
78|24|they will not tast therein [any] cool or drink

78|37|[from] the lord of the heaven and the earth and whatev is between them, the most merciful. they possess not from him [author for] speech.
78|38|th day that the spirit and the angel will stand in rows, they will not speak except for one whom the most merci permits, and he will say what is correct.
78|39|that is the true day; so he who will may take to hi lord a [way of] return.
78|40|indeed, We have warn you of a near punish on the day when a man will observ what hi hand have put forth and the disbeliev will say, "oh, I wish that I were dust!"
79|1|bi those [angels] who extract with violence
79|2|and [by] those who remov with ease
79|3|and [by] those who glide [a if] swimming
79|4|and those who race each other in a race
79|5|and those who arrang [each] matter,
79|6|on the day the blast [of the horn] will convuls [creation],
79|7|ther will follow it the subsequ [one].
79|8|hearts, that day, will tremble,
79|9|their eye humbled.
79|10|they are [presently] saying, "will we inde be return to [our] former state [of life]?
79|11|even if we should be decay bones?
79|12|they say, "that, then, would be a lose return."
79|13|indeed, it will be but one shout,
79|14|and suddenli they will be [alert] upon the earth' surface.
79|15|ha there reach you the stori of moses? -
79|16|when hi lord call to him in the sacr valley of tuwa,
79|17|"go to pharaoh. indeed, he ha transgressed.
79|18|and say to him, 'would you [be will to] purifi yourself
79|19|and let me guid you to your lord so you would fear [him]?'"
79|20|and he show him the greatest sign,
79|21|but pharaoh deni and disobeyed.
79|22|then he turn hi back, striving.
79|23|and he gather [hi people] and call out
79|24|and said, "I am your most exalt lord."
79|25|so allah seiz him in exemplari punish for the last and the first [transgression].
79|26|inde in that is a warn for whoever would fear [allah].
79|27|ar you a more difficult creation or is the heaven? allah construct it.
79|28|h rais it ceil and proport it.
79|29|and He darken it night and extract it brightness.
79|30|and after that He spread the earth.
79|31|h extract from it it water and it pasture,
79|32|and the mountain He set firmly
79|33|a provis for you and your graze livestock.
79|34|but when there come the greatest overwhelm calam -
79|35|the day when man will rememb that for which he strove,
79|36|and hellfir will be expos for [all] those who see -
79|37|so as for he who transgressed
79|38|and prefer the life of the world,
79|39|then indeed, hellfir will be [his] refuge.
79|40|but as for he who fear the posit of hi lord and prevent the soul from [unlawful] inclination,
79|41|then indeed, paradis will be [his] refuge.
79|42|they ask you, [O muhammad], about the hour: when is it arrival?
79|43|in what [position] are you that you should mention it?
79|44|to your lord is it finality.
79|45|y are onli a warner for those who fear it.
79|46|it will be, on the day they see it, as though they had not remain [in the world] except for an afternoon or a morn thereof.
80|1|th prophet frown and turn away
80|2|becaus there came to him the blind man, [interrupting].
80|3|but what would make you perceive, [O muhammad], that perhap he might be purified
80|4|or be remind and the remembr would benefit him?
80|5|a for he who think himself without need,
80|6|to him you give attention.
80|7|and not upon you [i ani blame] if he will not be purified.
80|8|but as for he who came to you strive [for knowledge]
80|9|whil he fear [allah],
80|10|from him you are distracted.
80|11|no! indeed, these vers are a reminder;
80|12|so whoever will may rememb it.
80|13|[it is recorded] in honor sheets,
80|14|exalt and purified,
80|15|[carried] by the hand of messenger-angels,
80|16|nobl and dutiful.
80|17|curs is man; how disbeliev is he.
80|18|from what substanc did He creat him?
80|19|from a sperm-drop He creat him and destin for him;
80|20|then He eas the way for him;
80|21|then He caus hi death and provid a grave for him.
80|22|then when He wills, He will resurrect him.
80|23|no! man ha not yet accomplish what He command him.
80|24|then let mankind look at hi food -
80|25|how We pour down water in torrents,
80|26|then We broke open the earth, split [it with sprouts],
80|27|and caus to grow within it grain
80|28|and grape and herbage
80|29|and oliv and palm trees
80|30|and garden of dens shrubbery
80|31|and fruit and grass -
80|32|[as] enjoy for you and your graze livestock.
80|33|but when there come the deafen blast
80|34|on the day a man will flee from hi brother
80|35|and hi mother and hi father
80|36|and hi wife and hi children,
80|37|for everi man, that day, will be a matter adequ for him.
80|38|[some] faces, that day, will be bright -
80|39|laughing, rejoic at good news.
80|40|and [other] faces, that day, will have upon them dust.
80|41|black will cover them.
80|42|thos are the disbelievers, the wick ones.
81|1|when the sun is wrap up [in darkness]
81|2|and when the star fall, dispersing,
81|3|and when the mountain are removed
81|4|and when full-term she-camel are neglected
81|5|and when the wild beast are gathered
81|6|and when the sea are fill with flame
81|7|and when the soul are paired
81|8|and when the girl [who was] buri aliv is asked
81|9|for what sin she wa killed
81|10|and when the page are made public
81|11|and when the sky is strip away
81|12|and when hellfir is set ablaze
81|13|and when paradis is brought near,
81|14|a soul will [then] know what it ha brought [with it].
81|15|so I swear by the retreat star -
81|16|those that run [their courses] and disappear -
81|17|and by the night as it close in
81|18|and by the dawn when it breathes
81|19|[that] indeed, the qur'an is a word [convey by] a nobl messenger
81|20|[who is] possess of power and with the owner of the throne, secur [in position],
81|21|obey there [in the heavens] and trustworthy.
81|22|and your companion is not [at all] mad.
81|23|and he ha alreadi seen gabriel in the clear horizon.
81|24|and muhammad is not a withhold of [knowledg of] the unseen.
81|25|and the qur'an is not the word of a devil, expel [from the heavens].
81|26|so where are you going?
81|27|it is not except a remind to the worlds
81|28|for whoever will among you to take a right course.
81|29|and you do not will except that allah will - lord of the worlds.
82|1|when the sky break apart
82|2|and when the star fall, scattering,
82|3|and when the sea are erupted
82|4|and when the [content of] grave are scattered,
82|5|a soul will [then] know what it ha put forth and kept back.
82|6|o mankind, what ha deceiv you concern your lord, the generous,
82|7|who creat you, proport you, and balanc you?
82|8|in whatev form He will ha He assembl you.
82|9|no! but you deni the recompense.
82|10|and indeed, [appointed] over you are keepers,
82|11|nobl and recording;
82|12|they know whatev you do.
82|13|indeed, the righteou will be in pleasure,
82|14|and indeed, the wick will be in hellfire.
82|15|they will [enter to] burn therein on the day of recompense,
82|16|and never therefrom will they be absent.
82|17|and what can make you know what is the day of recompense?
82|18|then, what can make you know what is the day of recompense?
82|19|it is the day when a soul will not possess for anoth soul [power to do] a thing; and the command, that day, is [entirely] with allah.
83|1|wo to those who give less [than due],
83|2|who, when they take a measur from people, take in full.
83|3|but if they give by measur or by weight to them, they caus loss.
83|4|do they not think that they will be resurrected
83|5|for a tremend day -
83|6|the day when mankind will stand befor the lord of the worlds?
83|7|no! indeed, the record of the wick is in sijjeen.
83|8|and what can make you know what is sijjeen?
83|9|it is [their destin record in] a regist inscribed.
83|10|woe, that day, to the deniers,
83|11|who deni the day of recompense.
83|12|and none deni it except everi sin transgressor.
83|13|when our vers are recit to him, he says, "legend of the former peoples."
83|14|no! rather, the stain ha cover their heart of that which they were earning.
83|15|no! indeed, from their lord, that day, they will be partitioned.
83|16|then indeed, they will [enter and] burn in hellfire.
83|17|then it will be said [to them], "thi is what you use to deny."
83|18|no! indeed, the record of the righteou is in 'illiyyun.
83|19|and what can make you know what is 'illiyyun?
83|20|it is [their destin record in] a regist inscribed
83|21|which is wit by those brought near [to allah].
83|22|indeed, the righteou will be in pleasure
83|23|on adorn couches, observing.
83|24|y will recogn in their face the radianc of pleasure.
83|25|they will be given to drink [pure] wine [which was] sealed.
83|26|th last of it is musk. So for thi let the competitor compete.
83|27|and it mixtur is of tasneem,
83|28|a spring from which those near [to allah] drink.
83|29|indeed, those who commit crime use to laugh at those who believed.
83|30|and when they pass by them, they would exchang deris glances.
83|31|and when they return to their people, they would return jesting.
83|32|and when they saw them, they would say, "indeed, those are truli lost."
83|33|but they had not been sent as guardian over them.
83|34|so today those who believ are laugh at the disbelievers,
83|35|on adorn couches, observing.
83|36|hav the disbeliev [not] been reward [thi day] for what they use to do?
84|1|when the sky ha split [open]
84|2|and ha respond to it lord and wa oblig [to do so]
84|3|and when the earth ha been extended
84|4|and ha cast out that within it and relinquish [it]
84|5|and ha respond to it lord and wa oblig [to do so] -
84|6|o mankind, inde you are labor toward your lord with [great] exert and will meet it.
84|7|then as for he who is given hi record in hi right hand,
84|8|h will be judg with an easi account
84|9|and return to hi peopl in happiness.
84|10|but as for he who is given hi record behind hi back,
84|11|h will cri out for destruction
84|12|and [enter to] burn in a blaze.
84|13|indeed, he had [once] been among hi peopl in happiness;
84|14|indeed, he had thought he would never return [to allah].
84|15|but yes! indeed, hi lord wa ever of him, seeing.
84|16|so I swear by the twilight glow
84|17|and [by] the night and what it envelops
84|18|and [by] the moon when it becom full
84|19|[that] you will sure experi state after state.
84|20|so what is [the matter] with them [that] they do not believe,
84|21|and when the qur'an is recit to them, they do not prostrat [to allah]?
84|22|but those who have disbeliev deny,
84|23|and allah is most know of what they keep within themselves.
84|24|so give them tide of a pain punishment,
84|25|except for those who believ and do righteou deeds. for them is a reward uninterrupted.
85|1|bi the sky contain great stars
85|2|and [by] the promis day
85|3|and [by] the wit and what is witnessed,
85|4|curs were the companion of the trench
85|5|[containing] the fire full of fuel,
85|6|when they were sit near it
85|7|and they, to what they were do against the believers, were witnesses.
85|8|and they resent them not except becaus they believ in allah, the exalt in might, the praiseworthy,
85|9|to whom belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth. and allah, over all things, is witness.
85|10|indeed, those who have tortur the believ men and believ women and then have not repent will have the punish of hell, and they will have the punish of the burn fire.
85|11|indeed, those who have believ and done righteou deed will have garden beneath which river flow. that is the great attainment.
85|12|indeed, the vengeanc of your lord is severe.

85|14|and He is the forgiving, the affectionate,
85|15|honor owner of the throne,
85|16|effect of what He intends.
85|17|ha there reach you the stori of the soldier -
85|18|[those of] pharaoh and thamud?
85|19|but they who disbeliev are in [persistent] denial,
85|20|whil allah encompass them from behind.
85|21|but thi is an honor qur'an
85|22|[inscribed] in a preserv slate.
86|1|bi the sky and the night comer -
86|2|and what can make you know what is the night comer?
86|3|it is the pierc star -
86|4|there is no soul but that it ha over it a protector.
86|5|so let man observ from what he wa created.
86|6|h wa creat from a fluid, ejected,
86|7|emerg from between the backbon and the ribs.
86|8|indeed, allah, to return him [to life], is able.
86|9|th day when secret will be put on trial,
86|10|then man will have no power or ani helper.
86|11|bi the sky which return [rain]
86|12|and [by] the earth which crack open,
86|13|indeed, the qur'an is a decis statement,
86|14|and it is not amusement.
86|15|indeed, they are plan a plan,
86|16|but I am plan a plan.
86|17|so allow time for the disbelievers. leav them awhile.
87|1|exalt the name of your lord, the most high,
87|2|who creat and proportioned
87|3|and who destin and [then] guided
87|4|and who bring out the pasture
87|5|and [then] make it black stubble.
87|6|w will make you recite, [O muhammad], and you will not forget,
87|7|except what allah should will. indeed, He know what is declar and what is hidden.
87|8|and We will eas you toward ease.
87|9|so remind, if the remind should benefit;
87|10|h who fear [allah] will be reminded.
87|11|but the wretch one will avoid it -
87|12|[he] who will [enter and] burn in the greatest fire,
87|13|neith die therein nor living.
87|14|h ha certainli succeed who purifi himself
87|15|and mention the name of hi lord and prays.
87|16|but you prefer the worldli life,
87|17|whil the hereaft is better and more enduring.
87|18|indeed, thi is in the former scriptures,
87|19|th scriptur of abraham and moses.
88|1|ha there reach you the report of the overwhelm [event]?
88|2|[some] faces, that day, will be humbled,
88|3|work [hard] and exhausted.
88|4|they will [enter to] burn in an intens hot fire.
88|5|they will be given drink from a boil spring.
88|6|for them there will be no food except from a poisonous, thorni plant
88|7|which neither nourish nor avail against hunger.
88|8|[other] faces, that day, will show pleasure.
88|9|with their effort [they are] satisfied
88|10|in an elev garden,
88|11|wherein they will hear no unsuit speech.
88|12|within it is a flow spring.
88|13|within it are couch rais high
88|14|and cup put in place
88|15|and cushion line up
88|16|and carpet spread around.
88|17|then do they not look at the camel - how they are created?
88|18|and at the sky - how it is raised?
88|19|and at the mountain - how they are erected?
88|20|and at the earth - how it is spread out?
88|21|so remind, [O muhammad]; you are onli a reminder.
88|22|y are not over them a controller.
88|23|however, he who turn away and disbeliev -
88|24|then allah will punish him with the greatest punishment.
88|25|indeed, to Us is their return.
88|26|then indeed, upon Us is their account.
89|1|bi the dawn
89|2|and [by] ten nights
89|3|and [by] the even [number] and the odd
89|4|and [by] the night when it passes,
89|5|i there [not] in [all] that an oath [sufficient] for one of perception?
89|6|hav you not consid how your lord dealt with 'aad -
89|7|[with] iram - who had lofti pillars,
89|8|th like of whom had never been creat in the land?
89|9|and [with] thamud, who carv out the rock in the valley?
89|10|and [with] pharaoh, owner of the stakes? -
89|11|[all of] whom oppress within the lands
89|12|and increas therein the corruption.
89|13|so your lord pour upon them a scourg of punishment.
89|14|indeed, your lord is in observation.
89|15|and as for man, when hi lord tri him and [thus] is gener to him and favor him, he says, "mi lord ha honor me."
89|16|but when He tri him and restrict hi provision, he says, "mi lord ha humili me."
89|17|no! but you do not honor the orphan
89|18|and you do not encourag one anoth to feed the poor.
89|19|and you consum inheritance, devour [it] altogether,
89|20|and you love wealth with immens love.
89|21|no! when the earth ha been level - pound and crush -
89|22|and your lord ha come and the angels, rank upon rank,
89|23|and brought [within view], that day, is hell - that day, man will remember, but what good to him will be the remembrance?
89|24|h will say, "oh, I wish I had sent ahead [some good] for my life."
89|25|so on that day, none will punish [a severely] as hi punishment,
89|26|and none will bind [a severely] as hi bind [of the evildoers].
89|27|[to the righteou it will be said], "O reassur soul,
89|28|return to your lord, well-pleas and pleas [to him],
89|29|and enter among My [righteous] servants
89|30|and enter My paradise."
90|1|i swear by thi city, makkah -
90|2|and you, [O muhammad], are free of restrict in thi citi -
90|3|and [by] the father and that which wa born [of him],
90|4|w have certainli creat man into hardship.
90|5|do he think that never will anyon overcom him?
90|6|h says, "I have spent wealth in abundance."
90|7|do he think that no one ha seen him?
90|8|hav We not made for him two eyes?
90|9|and a tongu and two lips?
90|10|and have shown him the two ways?
90|11|but he ha not broken through the difficult pass.
90|12|and what can make you know what is [break through] the difficult pass?
90|13|it is the free of a slave
90|14|or feed on a day of sever hunger
90|15|an orphan of near relationship
90|16|or a needi person in misery
90|17|and then be among those who believ and advis one anoth to patienc and advis one anoth to compassion.
90|18|thos are the companion of the right.
90|19|but they who disbeliev in our sign - those are the companion of the left.
90|20|ov them will be fire close in.
91|1|bi the sun and it brightness
91|2|and [by] the moon when it follow it
91|3|and [by] the day when it display it
91|4|and [by] the night when it cover it

91|6|and [by] the earth and He who spread it
91|7|and [by] the soul and He who proport it
91|8|and inspir it [with discern of] it wicked and it righteousness,
91|9|h ha succeed who purifi it,
91|10|and he ha fail who instil it [with corruption].
91|11|thamud deni [their prophet] by reason of their transgression,
91|12|when the most wretch of them wa sent forth.
91|13|and the messeng of allah [salih] said to them, "[do not harm] the she-camel of allah or [prevent her from] her drink."
91|14|but they deni him and hamstrung her. So their lord brought down upon them destruct for their sin and made it equal [upon all of them].
91|15|and He doe not fear the consequ thereof.
92|1|bi the night when it covers
92|2|and [by] the day when it appears
92|3|and [by] He who creat the male and female,
92|4|indeed, your effort are diverse.
92|5|a for he who give and fear allah
92|6|and believ in the best [reward],
92|7|w will eas him toward ease.
92|8|but as for he who withhold and consid himself free of need
92|9|and deni the best [reward],
92|10|w will eas him toward difficulty.
92|11|and what will hi wealth avail him when he falls?
92|12|indeed, [incumbent] upon Us is guidance.
92|13|and indeed, to Us belong the hereaft and the first [life].
92|14|so I have warn you of a fire which is blazing.
92|15|non will [enter to] burn therein except the most wretch one.
92|16|who had deni and turn away.
92|17|but the righteou one will avoid it -

93|4|and the hereaft is better for you than the first [life].
93|5|and your lord is go to give you, and you will be satisfied.
93|6|did He not find you an orphan and give [you] refuge?
93|7|and He found you lost and guid [you],
93|8|and He found you poor and made [you] self-sufficient.
93|9|so as for the orphan, do not oppress [him].
93|10|and as for the petitioner, do not repel [him].
93|11|but as for the favor of your lord, report [it].
94|1|did We not expand for you, [O muhammad], your breast?
